"""Process-wide idempotency store for the greenfield core/ platforms.

Wraps :class:`adcp.server.idempotency.IdempotencyStore` with a
:class:`PgBackend` that survives across workers — required for any
deployment running ≥2 processes (which managed-mode and the legacy
gunicorn topology both do).

The pool + store are built lazily on first access, so module import
remains side-effect-free for tooling that pulls in core.platforms.* for
introspection (OpenAPI export, alembic autogen, etc.) without a live
DATABASE_URL.

Test-only: set ``CORE_IDEMPOTENCY_BACKEND=memory`` to fall back to
:class:`MemoryBackend`. Used by storyboard tests where spinning up a Pg
pool for every assertion is overkill.

**Atomicity caveat (SDK #555).** :meth:`PgBackend.put` commits on a
fresh pool connection — separate from the handler's business
transaction. Handlers that mutate state without a unique constraint on
their ``idempotency_key`` (e.g. ``_create_media_buy_impl`` inserting
into ``media_buys``) may double-execute on a crash between handler
success and cache commit. Tracked separately; PgBackend is still the
right default — it's a strict improvement over MemoryBackend's
single-process scope.

    The framework's :class:`IdempotencyStore.wrap` raises
    :class:`IdempotencyConflictError` when the same idempotency_key is reused
    with a materially different (post-JCS-canonicalization) payload — a
    spec-defined buyer mistake, not a server failure. Without translation the
    untyped exception bubbles through the dispatcher's generic catch-all and
    surfaces as ``INTERNAL_ERROR`` (terminal), discarding the spec's
    correctable classification and breaking buyer-side retry-with-fresh-key
    recovery.

    Apply this decorator OUTSIDE the ``@_IDEMPOTENCY.wrap`` decorator on every
    platform method that uses idempotency caching::

    Decorator stacking order matters: ``@_IDEMPOTENCY.wrap`` must wrap the raw
    method first (innermost), then ``@translate_idempotency_conflict`` wraps
    the wrap (outermost) so it sees the conflict exception when the framework
    invokes the platform method.
