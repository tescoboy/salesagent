"""Process-wide idempotency store for the greenfield core/ platforms.

Wraps :class:`adcp.server.idempotency.IdempotencyStore` with a
:class:`PgBackend` that survives across workers — required for any
deployment running ≥2 processes (which managed-mode and the legacy
gunicorn topology both do).

The pool + store are built lazily on first access, so module import
remains side-effect-free for tooling that pulls in core.platforms.* for
introspection (OpenAPI export, alembic autogen, etc.) without a live
DATABASE_URL.

Test-only: set ``CORE_IDEMPOTENCY_BACKEND=memory`` to fall back to
:class:`MemoryBackend`. Used by storyboard tests where spinning up a Pg
pool for every assertion is overkill.

**Atomicity caveat (SDK #555).** :meth:`PgBackend.put` commits on a
fresh pool connection — separate from the handler's business
transaction. Handlers that mutate state without a unique constraint on
their ``idempotency_key`` (e.g. ``_create_media_buy_impl`` inserting
into ``media_buys``) may double-execute on a crash between handler
success and cache commit. Tracked separately; PgBackend is still the
right default — it's a strict improvement over MemoryBackend's
single-process scope.

    """Decorator: translate framework :class:`IdempotencyConflictError` to a
    wire-shaped :class:`AdcpError` with code ``IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`` and
    ``recovery="correctable"``.

    The framework's :class:`IdempotencyStore.wrap` raises
    :class:`IdempotencyConflictError` when the same idempotency_key is reused
    with a materially different (post-JCS-canonicalization) payload — a
    spec-defined buyer mistake, not a server failure. Without translation the
    untyped exception bubbles through the dispatcher's generic catch-all and
    surfaces as ``INTERNAL_ERROR`` (terminal), discarding the spec's
    correctable classification and breaking buyer-side retry-with-fresh-key
    recovery.

    Spec invariant — do NOT special-case correctable-rejection caching: the
    framework caches by ``(caller_identity, key, JCS(payload))``, and AdCP
    treats the idempotency_key as identifying an *attempt*, not an *intent*.
    After any non-success response (including correctable rejections like
    ``TERMS_REJECTED``), the spec answer is for the buyer to mint a fresh
    ``uuid.uuid4()`` and retry — not for the seller to invalidate cache
    entries based on the response classification. Trying to "fix" that
    breaks the JCS-payload-equality invariant.

    Apply this decorator OUTSIDE the ``@_IDEMPOTENCY.wrap`` decorator on every
    platform method that uses idempotency caching::

        @translate_idempotency_conflict
        @_IDEMPOTENCY.wrap
        async def create_media_buy(self, req, ctx) -> dict[str, Any]:
            ...

    Decorator stacking order matters: ``@_IDEMPOTENCY.wrap`` must wrap the raw
    method first (innermost), then ``@translate_idempotency_conflict`` wraps
    the wrap (outermost) so it sees the conflict exception when the framework
    invokes the platform method.

    """:class:`IdempotencyStore` subclass that injects ``replayed: true`` on
    the cache-hit envelope.

    AdCP L1/security idempotency rule 4 mandates that a cached-response replay
    MUST set the envelope-level ``replayed`` flag so buyer agents can suppress
    side effects (notifications, downstream tool calls, memory writes) on
    retry. The upstream :class:`IdempotencyStore.wrap` returns the cached
    response verbatim — the library docstring on :class:`CachedResponse`
    states explicitly that "the seller injects ``replayed: true`` at the
    envelope level before sending." This subclass performs that injection.

    Implementation note: we reimplement the full :meth:`wrap` body inline
    (rather than pre-checking and delegating to ``super().wrap()``) so the
    cache lookup and the ``replayed`` injection happen in a single code path.
    A pre-check-then-delegate design has a narrow race: worker A misses our
    pre-check and delegates; worker B's pre-check also misses and delegates;
    A populates the cache; B's delegated library wrap then performs its own
    ``backend.get`` and returns the cached response **without** the
    ``replayed`` flag — exactly the bug this class exists to fix, just on a
    narrower window. Inlining the wrap closes that window.
