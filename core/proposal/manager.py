"""SalesAgentProposalManager — wraps salesagent's get_products with the
v1.5 ``ProposalManager`` primitive so a single code path serves both
the stateless ``buying_mode='brief'`` flow AND the stateful
``buying_mode='refine'`` proposal-iteration flow.

Architectural shape (per @bokelley): every seller's get_products is
*conceptually* a proposal generation step — the response is a proposed
configuration of products, pricing, formats, inventory hints. v1.5
ProposalManager + ProposalStore lifts that fully into a managed
primitive: ``get_products`` produces a draft, ``refine_products``
iterates, ``ProposalStore.commit`` persists, and downstream
``create_media_buy(proposal_id=X)`` consumes via ``try_reserve_consumption``
+ ``finalize_consumption``.

When the framework's :class:`LazyPlatformRouter` has a wired
:class:`ProposalManager` for a tenant, it routes ``get_products`` to
``manager.get_products`` instead of ``platform.get_products`` —
subsuming the call entirely. ``platform.get_products`` becomes the
fallback for tenants without a manager wired (none of ours, but the
framework keeps it for migration).

v1 scope: stateless ``get_products`` that delegates to
``_get_products_impl`` (same brain as core/platforms/_delegate.py).
DRAFT persistence + refinement land in v2 once the storyboard's
sales-proposal-mode bundle drives them. Keep the surface narrow until
real flows demand more — premature lifecycle hooks would lock us into
shapes that don't match the actual proposal flow we want.
