# Entity Test Surface Mapping

Create canonical test suites per domain entity by mapping all test obligations
to real tests or stubs. This gives complete visibility into what's tested and
what's missing.

## Args

```
/surface <entity-name-1> [entity-name-2] ...
```

Entity names (space-separated). Each gets a test file at
`tests/unit/test_{entity_name}.py` (hyphens → underscores).

## Entity → Obligations Mapping

| Entity | Primary Obligations | Output File |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| product | UC-001 | test_product.py |
| media-buy | UC-002, UC-003 | test_media_buy.py |
| delivery | UC-004 | test_delivery.py |
| creative-formats | UC-005 | test_creative_formats.py |
| creative | BR-UC-006 | test_creative.py |
| properties | BR-UC-007 | test_properties.py |
| audience-signals | BR-UC-008 | test_audience_signals.py |
| performance | BR-UC-009 | test_performance.py |
| capabilities | BR-UC-010 | test_capabilities.py |
| pricing-option | business-rules, constraints | test_pricing_option.py |
| transport-boundary | #1050/#1066 principles | test_transport_boundary.py |

All entities also check cross-cutting files: `business-rules.md`, `constraints.md`.

## What You Get

For each entity, a test module containing:
- **Real tests**: Ported from existing (possibly scattered) test files
- **Skip stubs**: `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="STUB: [obligation-ID]")` for every gap
- **Obligation traceability**: Each test/stub references its obligation ID

Open `test_creative.py` → see 89 test names → 30 real, 59 stubs → know exactly what's missing.

## Protocol

For each entity, walk these steps in conversation:

```
gather-obligations → audit-existing → review → triage → generate-suite → verify → commit
```

### Done when all entity suites committed

Coverage summary generated.

## Naming Rules

Test names describe **behavior**, not bugs:
- `test_create_media_buy_rejects_missing_brand` (behavior)
- NOT: `test_bug_fix_123` or `test_v2_compat` (incident-driven)
