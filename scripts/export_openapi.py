"""Export the Tenant Management API OpenAPI spec to a static artifact.

Why a static artifact when spectree already serves
``/api/v1/tenant-management/openapi.json`` at runtime:

* **SDK generation.** Scope3 (and any other consumer) generates a typed
  client from the spec. Pulling from runtime requires a live server;
  a checked-in artifact lets them generate from any clone.
* **API-drift visibility.** PR diffs that touch endpoint shape show
  the spec change inline. Without the static file, schema regressions
  are invisible to reviewers.
* **Stable reference.** Tag a snapshot per release; consumers pin to
  it.

Usage::

    uv run python scripts/export_openapi.py
    # writes docs/api/tenant-management-openapi.{json,yaml}

The structural test
``tests/unit/test_openapi_export_in_sync.py`` regenerates the spec at
test time and fails if the committed file drifts. CI catches stale
specs without manual diff-checking.
