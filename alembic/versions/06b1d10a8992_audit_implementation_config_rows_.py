"""Audit implementation_config rows against reconciled schemas.

Revision ID: 06b1d10a8992
Revises: 9cc36dfc54f6
Create Date: 2026-04-30 13:32:37.398166

Validation-only migration — no schema changes. Iterates every row in
``products`` whose ``implementation_config`` is non-null, joins to the
tenant's ``adapter_type``, and validates the dict against the registered
``*ProductConfig`` Pydantic schema for that adapter (#1240, #1241, #1242,
#1244). Fails the migration with a row-by-row report of malformed configs
so operators are forced to clean up bad data before deploy completes.

Rationale
---------

The reconciled schemas (BaseProductConfig with ``extra='forbid'``) reject
configs that have unknown fields or invalid values. The adapter-boundary
read code (post-#1244) raises ``ValidationError`` on bad configs. Without
this audit, the first request after deploy would fail at runtime with a
poor error surface (cascading errors, possible partial state).

This migration runs the same validation up-front, in a transactional
context, with a comprehensive report. Operators see every bad row at
once and can fix the data before the runtime path ever sees it.

Adapters covered: mock, broadstreet, google_ad_manager (and "gam" alias).
Other adapter types (kevel, triton, xandr) are skipped with a debug
log — schemas haven't been reconciled for them yet (out of scope for
#1239). Empty/missing implementation_config rows are skipped.

Imports of the reconciled schemas are deferred into upgrade() so the
migration file loads cleanly even on revisions where the schema modules
don't exist yet (e.g., during stacked-PR review).

downgrade() is a no-op — this migration changes no schema.
