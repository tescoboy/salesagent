"""SignalUsage repository — count live media buys referencing a TenantSignal.

A ``signal_id`` lands inside the create_media_buy request JSON at
``packages[*].targeting_overlay.audience_include`` and
``audience_exclude`` (and defensively at the request top level for the
update-shape, where AdCP also accepts these keys). We persist that
payload verbatim on ``MediaBuy.raw_request`` (JSONB). To answer "which
signals are buyers actually referencing right now?" we scan the live
subset of buys for the tenant and walk the JSON in Python.

**What counts as live?** Anything *not* in a terminal status. We use an
exclusion list — terminal = ``{completed, canceled, cancelled, rejected,
failed}``. Everything else counts:

- ``active`` / ``approved`` — serving now
- ``paused`` — temporarily not serving but will resume
- ``pending_creatives`` / ``pending_start`` / ``pending_approval`` —
  waiting on something, will serve once it clears
- ``draft`` — not yet committed but the reference is recorded

Inverting from an allowlist to a denylist matches the safety invariant:
a delete should be blocked when a buy *could* serve, not only when it
*is* serving. New statuses introduced by future PRs default to "live"
unless explicitly added to the terminal set.

Why Python iteration and not JSONB path queries: the rest of the
codebase walks ``raw_request`` in Python (see
``src/core/tools/media_buy_delivery.py``) and operates at publisher
scale — typically <1000 live buys per tenant. A single SELECT + dict
walk is cheaper than maintaining a JSONB-path query idiom that doesn't
exist elsewhere in the codebase.
