"""Model-layer write guard for platform-managed tenant surfaces.

Sprint 1 of [embedded-mode](../../../docs/design/embedded-mode.md):
the boundary between platform-managed and publisher-managed surfaces is
infrastructure vs. business. Platform-managed surfaces (Tenant core columns,
AdapterConfig) are locked to the Tenant Management API on tenants flagged
`is_embedded=True`. Publisher-managed surfaces (Product, Principal,
Creative, Workflow, etc.) remain writable from the UI for embedded tenants.

Enforcement: SQLAlchemy mapper-level `before_insert`/`before_update` listeners
inspect the active session for an authorization flag set by the management
API entrypoint (or a super-admin override for ops). Any write to a
platform-managed surface from any other code path raises
:class:`EmbeddedTenantWriteError`.

API endpoints set the flag on entry::

    with get_db_session() as session:
        session.info["management_api_caller"] = True
        ...

Super-admin tooling sets ``session.info["super_admin_override"] = True`` for
emergency manual mutations.

Importing this module attaches the listeners as a side effect; no further
wiring is required.
