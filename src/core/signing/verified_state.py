"""Request-scoped contextvar bridge for verified RFC 9421 signature state.

PR 2B of [signing-non-embedded](../../../../docs/design/signing-non-embedded.md).

The :class:`SigningVerifyMiddleware` runs at the ASGI layer and produces three
fields per accepted signature: the operator id, the agent_url that signed,
and the JWK ``kid`` that matched. Downstream handlers (FastMCP middleware,
A2A handlers, ``resolve_identity_from_context``) need to read these values
without coupling to the ASGI scope shape.

We use a single :class:`contextvars.ContextVar` because the verifier
middleware and downstream identity resolvers run in the same asyncio task —
contextvars propagate naturally across that boundary, including across
``await`` and through the FastMCP middleware chain.
