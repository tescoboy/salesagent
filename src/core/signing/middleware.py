"""Starlette ASGI middleware for inbound RFC 9421 signature verification.

Per-buyer-agent trust model. Each :class:`Principal` optionally carries a
``brand_domain`` (operator-typed buyer domain — the trust anchor) plus a
``signing_required`` flag. When the verifier sees a signature, it walks
``https://<brand_domain>/.well-known/brand.json`` via
:class:`adcp.signing.BrandJsonJwksResolver`, which auto-refreshes on
cooldown + unknown-kid cascade so JWKS rotation propagates without
operator action.

Enforcement is per-principal — there is no tenant-wide kill switch and no
per-operation gating list. An operator marks an individual buyer agent as
"must sign" by setting ``signing_required=True`` on their principal row.

Buffers the request body up front (so the verifier reads digest-covered body
AND downstream handlers see the same bytes via a replay-receive callable),
extracts the AdCP operation name, then:

* Signed request → verify against ``brand.json`` (walked per-request,
  library-cached) or 401.
* Unsigned request from principal with ``signing_required=True`` → 401
  ``request_signature_required``.
* Anything else → pass through (bearer auth handles the principal lookup).

Verifier tuning (skew window, replay window, content-digest policy) is
deployment-level, read from ``ADCP_SIGNING_*`` env vars on construction.
