"""Per-buyer-agent brand.json resolver cache.

Each :class:`Principal` carries a ``brand_domain`` (operator-typed buyer
domain — the trust anchor) that points at
``https://<brand_domain>/.well-known/brand.json``. The verifier looks up
JWKS by walking that brand.json via :class:`adcp.signing.BrandJsonJwksResolver`,
which handles:

* Cooldown-respecting brand.json re-walks (default 1h, honors counterparty
  ``Cache-Control``)
* Unknown-kid cascade: when the verifier asks for a kid the resolver hasn't
  seen, the resolver re-fetches brand.json + JWKS rather than returning
  ``None`` and forcing operator intervention
* IP-pinned transport (DNS-rebinding-safe)
* Same-origin guard on the implicit ``jwks_uri`` fallback

We cache one resolver instance per ``(tenant_id, principal_id)`` so concurrent
verifies on the same principal share the cooldown window + JWK set without
re-walking brand.json from scratch.

This replaces the prior model where we stored ``jwks_uri`` as a column and
constructed a :class:`CachingJwksResolver` directly — that bypassed the
library's brand.json-walk semantics, so a buyer rotating ``jwks_uri`` in
their brand.json would never propagate without manual operator re-resolve.
