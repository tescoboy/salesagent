"""Embedded-mode capability flags.

On embedded instances, the storefront (upstream host product) may absorb
workflows that the salesagent historically owned — creative approval,
Slack notifications, advertising policy, etc. ``EMBEDDED_CAPABILITIES``
is a JSON env var that names which workflows the storefront has taken
over for this salesagent instance. The salesagent hides UI and rejects
writes for any workflow owned by the storefront.

Why instance-level, not per-tenant: one embedded salesagent corresponds
to one storefront operator. The storefront decides once which workflows
it owns across all of its tenants.

Why env-var, not DB: ownership flips at the storefront's release pace,
not the salesagent's. An env-var bump is a deploy; a DB column would
need a migration plus a per-tenant rollout. Same reason ``MANAGED_INSTANCE``
is an env var.

Open instances (``MANAGED_INSTANCE`` unset or false): the env var is
ignored entirely. ``capability_owner()`` always returns ``"publisher"``,
``publisher_owns()`` always returns ``True``. There is no embedded
storefront to take ownership.

Format::

    EMBEDDED_CAPABILITIES='{"creative_approval": "storefront", "slack": "storefront"}'

Unknown keys → default ``"publisher"`` (the rule), with one exception
documented in ``_EMBEDDED_DEFAULTS``: capabilities that pre-existed
the publisher-default rule and shipped as storefront-owned. New
capabilities should follow the default and stay out of that dict.

Invalid JSON or non-``str`` values → ``ValueError`` at first call
(fail loud — misconfiguration silently leaving every workflow on the
publisher side would be the worst failure mode).
