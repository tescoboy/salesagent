"""Outbound webhook event publication.

Sprint 6 of [embedded-mode](../../../docs/design/embedded-mode-sprint-6.md).

The single entry point :func:`publish_event` is called by business code
when a tenant lifecycle event fires (workflow approved/rejected, sync
completes, etc.). Lookup of active subscriptions happens synchronously;
delivery is fire-and-forget via ``asyncio.create_task`` so the calling
request handler isn't blocked.

The plaintext webhook secret needed for signing is **not** stored in the
database — only its sha256 hash is. Therefore the publisher needs the
plaintext to be passed in by the caller that created the subscription, OR
the system must look it up via a sidecar mechanism. Sprint 6 solves this
by holding the plaintext in an in-memory cache populated at create time;
on process restart, subscriptions whose secrets aren't cached are
suspended until a cache rebuild path lands. This is a deliberate v1
limitation documented in the spec's "Open Questions" — production-grade
durable secret storage is sprint-7-or-later.

For tests and the synchronous test endpoint, the secret is supplied at the
call site (the test endpoint regenerates a fresh secret and posts with it).
