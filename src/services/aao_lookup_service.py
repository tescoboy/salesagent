    """Live AAO snapshot for a single publisher partner.

    Returned by :func:`get_publisher_partner_status` and consumed by:

    - The Publisher Partnerships UI (renders ``"47 / 200 authorized"`` and the
      status chip).
    - The ``sync_publisher_partners`` cron / Verify-All endpoint (persists the
      counts on :class:`PublisherPartner` so the UI doesn't re-hit AAO on
      every page load).

    ``status`` — the five operationally-distinct cases the UI cares about
    (see salesagent#377 for the rationale on why this is finer than the
    spec's binary "valid/invalid"):

    - ``authorized`` — our agent's entry has typed binding
                       (``authorization_type`` + selector) resolving to ≥1
                       property. Spec-conformant and operational.
    - ``unbound``    — our agent is listed in ``authorized_agents`` with no
                       ``authorization_type`` (bare entry), but the file
                       has a top-level ``properties[]`` block. Not
                       spec-conformant — the SDK's strict resolver returns
                       []  — but the publisher's intent is clear and we
                       resolve permissively to all top-level properties.
                       Real-world repro: wonderstruck.org, Raptive (when
                       they ship properties). Operator should nudge the
                       publisher to add ``authorization_type`` but products
                       work today.
    - ``pending``    — file fetched cleanly, has properties, but our agent
                       isn't listed in ``authorized_agents`` at all.
                       Operator sends the AAO onboarding link
                       (:attr:`aao_onboarding_url`).
    - ``no_properties`` — file fetched cleanly but exposes zero properties
                       to anyone (no top-level array, no inline). Even if
                       we're listed there's nothing to sell. Publisher
                       must add a ``properties[]`` block before this row
                       can do anything.
    - ``unreachable`` — the adagents.json fetch failed (DNS, 404, parse
                       error, timeout). :attr:`error` carries the message.
