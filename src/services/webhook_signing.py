"""Webhook authentication header builder.

Slice 3 of the per-buyer-agent signing refactor. Translates a
:class:`PushNotificationConfig` row's ``signing_mode`` into the actual
``headers`` dict the delivery transport should attach to the outgoing
POST. Callers stay transport-shaped (``httpx``, ``requests``, etc.) —
this module only knows about hash + RFC 9421.

Modes:

* ``hmac`` — legacy ``X-ADCP-Signature`` HMAC-SHA256 header (existing
  behavior).
* ``rfc9421`` — :rfc:`9421` ``Signature`` + ``Signature-Input`` headers
  (and ``Content-Digest`` when the signing call covers it). HMAC is
  NOT attached.
* ``both`` — **transition only.** Emits both flavors so a buyer can
  cut over to RFC 9421 verification while keeping their HMAC verifier
  as a fallback. The two flavors cover non-equivalent payloads (HMAC
  hashes ``timestamp.body``; RFC 9421 covers method + target-uri +
  content-digest + content-type), so leaving ``both`` enabled forever
  means buyers maintain two non-equivalent integrity proofs in
  perpetuity. Sunset: 2026-12-31. After that date, operators should
  switch buyers to ``rfc9421`` and the mode will be removed in a
  follow-up release. (Tracked in issue #44.)

The body is taken as ``bytes`` — the caller is responsible for
serializing the JSON payload exactly once and using the same bytes for
the wire send and the signature input. Re-encoding (sort_keys, etc.)
between sign and send is a known footgun: the signed signature base
won't match the body the verifier hashes.
