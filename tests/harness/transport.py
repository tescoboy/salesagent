"""Transport enum and TransportResult for multi-transport behavioral tests.

Defines the dispatch transports (IMPL, MCP) and a frozen result
container that separates transport-specific envelope from shared payload.

A2A is no longer dispatched in-process — the framework's
``adcp.server.serve(transport="a2a")`` owns that surface, exercised
end-to-end by storyboards in ``core/tests/storyboards/``.

REST is no longer a transport — the legacy FastAPI app was deleted in
the kill-nginx cutover. Tools are now reachable only through MCP and
A2A (the two protocols AdCP defines), plus the IMPL shortcut for
business-logic tests that don't need the transport boundary.

Usage::

    result = env.call_via(Transport.MCP, creatives=[...])
    assert result.is_success
    assert result.payload.creatives[0].action == CreativeAction.created
