"""Canonical valid AdCP wire bodies for ``_delegate_*`` tests.

The ``_delegate_*`` functions in ``core.platforms._delegate`` validate the
incoming request through Pydantic before dispatching to the impl. Tests that
exercise *post-validation* behavior (translation, forwarding, response
projection) need a body that passes coercion — the specific field values
don't matter, but the shape must satisfy ``CreateMediaBuyRequest`` and
friends.

Centralizing these bodies prevents the same minimal-valid shape from
diverging across tests when the request schema changes (e.g. adding a new
required field). Each helper returns a fresh ``dict`` so tests can mutate
without affecting each other.
