"""Regression test: ``MockSellerPlatform.update_media_buy`` must NOT
preempt the SDK's ``inject_context``.

Issue #95: the e2e ``test_complete_campaign_lifecycle_with_webhooks``
fails asserting ``response.context == {'e2e': 'update_media_buy'}``
but receives ``{'e2e': 'create_media_buy'}``. Root cause: the mock's
update_media_buy returns ``_project_media_buy(record)``; the record
stores the create-time ``context`` and the projection includes it.
The SDK's :func:`adcp.server.helpers.inject_context` only fills
``response.context`` when it is **not already present**, so the
buyer's update-call context is silently dropped.

Fix: update_media_buy strips the record's stored context from its
projected response, letting :func:`inject_context` fill from the
request body.
