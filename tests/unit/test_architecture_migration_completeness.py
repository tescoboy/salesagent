"""Guard: every alembic migration must have non-empty upgrade() and downgrade().

A migration with an empty downgrade is unrecoverable in production. A migration
with an empty upgrade is dead code that clutters the migration chain.

Merge migrations (empty upgrade + empty downgrade) are exempt — they only
reconcile branch heads and contain no schema changes.

This guard also checks that downgrade() reverses the structural changes made by
upgrade() — specifically, that if upgrade() creates/drops tables, constraints,
or columns, the downgrade() references the same tables.
