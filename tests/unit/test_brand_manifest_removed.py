"""Tests that naming utilities correctly use brand (BrandReference) instead of brand_manifest.

After adcp 3.6.0, CreateMediaBuyRequest no longer has brand_manifest.
It was replaced by brand (BrandReference with .domain and optional .brand_id).
Since adcp 3.9, account (AccountReference) is also required.

These tests demonstrate that the naming code in src/core/utils/naming.py and
src/adapters/gam/utils/naming.py fail to extract brand information from real
adcp request objects because they still look for the removed brand_manifest
attribute.
