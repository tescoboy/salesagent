"""Auth gate on the publisher_partners blueprint.

Closes #65: the 5 routes accept GET/POST/DELETE under tenant scope and
**must** require authentication. Pre-fix: anonymous callers could
enumerate partners, create rogue records, delete by sequential ID, or
trigger outbound sync (SSRF amplification). Each route now wears
``@require_tenant_access(api_mode=True)``.

The structural guard
``tests/unit/test_architecture_tenant_routes_decorated.py`` enforces the
decorator's *presence*; this file locks in the *behavior*. If the
decorator's enforcement ever loosens, we want to know here too — not
just at AST level.

The test uses an arbitrary tenant_id — anonymous callers hit the auth
check *before* the route handler runs, so the tenant doesn't need to
exist in the DB. Keeps the test cheap and avoids re-deriving a
factory-binding fixture.
