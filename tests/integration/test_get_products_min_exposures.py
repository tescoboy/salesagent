- Guaranteed products: filtered by estimated_exposures vs min_exposures threshold
- Non-guaranteed products: included if price_guidance present (via get_recommended_cpm)

The DynamicPricingService mock is configured to set estimated_exposures on
products during enrichment, simulating real dynamic pricing behavior.

Obligations covered:
- UC-001-ALT-FILTERED-DISCOVERY-22: min_exposures with guaranteed product (forecast meets threshold)
- UC-001-ALT-FILTERED-DISCOVERY-23: min_exposures with guaranteed product (forecast below threshold)
- UC-001-ALT-FILTERED-DISCOVERY-24: min_exposures with non-guaranteed product (price_guidance present)
