"""Global CSRF defense for the admin Flask app.

Refuses mutating cookie-authed POSTs from third-party origins. The
session cookie is ``SameSite=None`` for OAuth flow reasons, so the
cookie rides cross-origin POSTs — only the Origin/Referer comparison
reliably distinguishes a legit admin form submission from a CSRF
attack on ``evil.example.com``.

This guard is on top of the per-route Origin checks the signing-keys
admin shipped with (PR #234) — defense in depth, plus closes #32 for
every other admin POST that didn't have its own check.

Tests run with ``TESTING=False`` to exercise the production path —
the default conftest fixture sets ``TESTING=True`` (which bypasses
the guard so legacy tests don't break).
