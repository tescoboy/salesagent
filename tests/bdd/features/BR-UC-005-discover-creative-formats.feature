Feature: BR-UC-005 Discover Creative Formats
  As a Buyer (Human or AI Agent)
  I want to discover what creative formats a seller accepts
  So that I can prepare compliant creative assets before creating media buys

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer knows the complete catalog of creative formats available from this seller
  #   POST-S2: Buyer knows the asset requirements (type, dimensions, required/optional) for each format
  #   POST-S3: Buyer knows which formats match their filter criteria (when filters applied)
  #   POST-S4: Buyer knows about additional creative agents they can query for more formats
  #   POST-F1: Buyer knows the operation failed
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what went wrong (error explains the failure)
  #   POST-F3: Buyer knows how to recover (suggestion for corrective action)

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And at least one creative agent is registered with format definitions

  Scenario: Discover full format catalog via REST
    Given the creative agent registry has formats across multiple categories
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creative_formats task via A2A with no filters
    Then the response should include all registered formats
    And each format should include a format_id with agent_url and id
    And each format should include asset requirements with type and dimensions
    And the results should be sorted by name
    # POST-S1: Complete catalog returned
    # POST-S2: Asset requirements included per format

  Scenario Outline: Creative agent asset type boundary - <boundary_point>
    Given a seller with creative agent formats containing various asset types
    When the Buyer Agent queries creative agent formats at asset_types boundary "<boundary_point>"
    Then the creative agent asset type handling should be <expected>

    Examples:
      | boundary_point                                                  | expected |
      | image (first enum value)                                        | valid    |
      | url (last enum value)                                           | valid    |
      | Not provided (no filter)                                        | valid    |
      | vast (valid in media-buy variant but not in creative agent)     | invalid  |
      | Empty array                                                     | invalid  |

  Scenario: Sandbox account receives simulated creative formats with sandbox flag
    Given the request targets a sandbox account
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creative_formats request
    Then the response status should be "completed"
    And the response should contain "formats" array
    And the response should include sandbox equals true
    And no real ad platform API calls should have been made
    # BR-RULE-209 INV-1: inputs validated same as production
    # BR-RULE-209 INV-2: real ad platform calls suppressed
    # BR-RULE-209 INV-4: response includes sandbox: true

  @T-UC-005-sandbox-production @UC-005-MAIN-MCP-23 @invariant @br-rule-209 @sandbox
  Scenario: Production account creative formats response does not include sandbox flag
    Given the request targets a production account
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creative_formats request
    Then the response status should be "completed"
    And the response should contain "formats" array
    And the response should not include a sandbox field
    # BR-RULE-209 INV-5: production account -> sandbox absent

  @T-UC-005-sandbox-validation @UC-005-MAIN-MCP-23 @invariant @br-rule-209 @sandbox
  Scenario: Sandbox account with invalid filter returns real validation error
    Given the request targets a sandbox account
    When the Buyer Agent sends a list_creative_formats request with invalid dimension filters
    Then the response should indicate a validation error
    And the error should be a real validation error, not simulated
    And the error should include a suggestion for how to fix the issue
    # BR-RULE-209 INV-7: sandbox validation errors are real
    # POST-F3: suggestion field present
