Feature: BR-UC-001 Discover Available Inventory
  As a Buyer (via Buyer Agent)
  I want to discover what advertising inventory matches my campaign requirements
  So that I can evaluate products and proceed to purchasing

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer knows what inventory matches their request (may be empty)
  #   POST-S2: Buyer can evaluate each product's pricing, formats, delivery measurement, and catalog match data
  #   POST-S3: Buyer sees products ordered by relevance to their brief (when buying_mode is brief)
  #   POST-S4: Buyer only sees products they are authorized to access (implementation-only — not in protocol)
  #   POST-S5: Buyer knows the discovery request completed successfully
  #   POST-S6: Buyer can evaluate publisher-recommended proposals with budget allocations
  #   POST-S7: Buyer knows whether more results are available and how to retrieve them
  #   POST-S8: Buyer knows whether catalog matching was applied and which items matched
  #   POST-S9: Buyer knows the status of each refinement request
  #   POST-S10: Buyer receives only the requested product fields when sparse field selection is used
  #   POST-F1: System state is unchanged (read-only operation)
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows why the request failed
  #   POST-F3: Buyer knows how to fix the issue and retry

  Background:
    Given a Seller Agent is operational and accepting requests
    And a tenant exists with at least one product in the catalog

    Given the Seller Agent enforces security hardening
    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_products request
    Then the request should be validated against schema before processing
    And authentication should be checked before any data access
    And no internal system details should leak in error responses

    When the Buyer Agent sends a get_products request with:
    | field       | value     |
    | buying_mode | brief     |
    Then the response should indicate a validation error
    And the error should be a real validation error, not simulated
