Feature: BR-UC-006 Sync Creative Assets
  As a Buyer (AI Agent or Human User)
  I want to sync creative assets to the Seller's creative library
  So that creatives are validated, approved, and ready for media buy execution

  # Postconditions verified:
  #   POST-S1: Buyer knows which creatives were successfully created, updated, or unchanged
  #   POST-S2: Buyer knows the per-creative action taken (created, updated, unchanged, failed, deleted)
  #   POST-S3: Buyer knows which packages each creative was assigned to
  #   POST-S4: Buyer knows about any per-creative warnings or assignment errors
  #   POST-S5: Creatives requiring approval are routed to configured workflow
  #   POST-F1: Buyer knows the operation failed
  #   POST-F2: Buyer knows what went wrong
  #   POST-F3: Buyer knows how to recover
