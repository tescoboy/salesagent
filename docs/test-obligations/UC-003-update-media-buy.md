## 3.6 Upgrade Impact

### salesagent-7gnv: MediaBuy boundary drops buyer_campaign_ref, creative_deadline, ext fields
- **CRITICAL**: The `UpdateMediaBuyRequest` and related response models must preserve `buyer_campaign_ref`, `creative_deadline`, and `ext` fields across the boundary. In adcp 3.6, these fields may be newly required or renamed.
- Impact on: Main flow step 11 (response must include `buyer_ref`), all alternative flows returning success responses, and the request schema accepting `buyer_ref` for identification.
- Test obligation: Verify roundtrip serialization of `buyer_campaign_ref`, `creative_deadline`, and `ext` in both request and response models.

### salesagent-mq3n: PricingOption delivery lookup compares string to integer PK
- **MODERATE for UC-003**: While primarily a UC-004 issue, the `pricing_option_id` field appears in `AdCPPackageUpdate` and `AffectedPackage`. If update responses include pricing information, the string/integer mismatch could surface.
- Test obligation: Verify `pricing_option_id` type consistency in package update and affected package models.

### salesagent-goy2: Creative extends wrong adcp type
- **HIGH for creative flows**: UC-003 alt-creative-ids, alt-creatives-inline, and alt-creative-assignments all depend on creative models. If Creative extends the wrong base type, validation in steps 6-8 of alt-creative-ids may produce wrong results.
- Test obligation: Verify creative model inheritance chain is correct for all creative assignment validation paths.

### Schema changes in adcp 3.6
- `UpdateMediaBuyRequest` extends `LibraryUpdateMediaBuyRequest1` -- verify the library base class still matches expectations after 3.6 upgrade.
- `AdCPPackageUpdate` extends `LibraryPackageUpdate1` -- verify package update schema compatibility.
- `AffectedPackage` extends `LibraryPackage` -- verify affected package schema has all required fields.

## Test Scenarios

### Main Flow: Package Budget Update (Auto-Applied)
Source: UC-003-main-mcp.md

#### Scenario: Happy path -- update package budget via media_buy_id
**Obligation ID** UC-003-MAIN-01
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** an authenticated buyer who owns a media buy with one package, and the tenant is configured for auto-approval
**When** the buyer sends `update_media_buy` with `media_buy_id` and one `packages` entry containing `package_id` and updated `budget`
**Then** the system returns a success response in a protocol envelope with status `completed`, containing `media_buy_id`, `buyer_ref`, `implementation_date` (non-null), and `affected_packages` array with the updated package
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-018 (atomic response: success XOR error), BR-RULE-022 (partial update semantics)
**Priority** P0 -- core happy path

#### Scenario: Happy path -- update package budget via buyer_ref
**Obligation ID** UC-003-MAIN-02
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** an authenticated buyer who owns a media buy, identified by `buyer_ref`
**When** the buyer sends `update_media_buy` with `buyer_ref` (no `media_buy_id`) and a package budget update
**Then** the system resolves the media buy via buyer_ref and returns success with updated package
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-021 (dual identification XOR)
**Priority** P0 -- alternative identification path

#### Scenario: Partial update semantics -- omitted fields unchanged
**Obligation ID** UC-003-MAIN-03
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a media buy with `start_time`, `end_time`, `budget`, and `paused` all set
**When** the buyer sends `update_media_buy` with only a package budget change (no timing, no pause)
**Then** `start_time`, `end_time`, and `paused` remain at their original values; only the specified package budget changes
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-022 (INV-1: present fields updated, INV-2: omitted fields unchanged)
**Priority** P0 -- fundamental contract

#### Scenario: Empty update rejected
**Obligation ID** UC-003-MAIN-04
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** an authenticated buyer who owns a media buy
**When** the buyer sends `update_media_buy` with only identification (no updatable fields)
**Then** the system returns an error (request must not be empty)
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-022 (INV-3: no updatable fields = rejected)
**Priority** P1

#### Scenario: Currency limit validation on package budget update
**Obligation ID** UC-003-MAIN-05
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a media buy with a 30-day flight and a tenant with `max_daily_package_spend` of $1000
**When** the buyer updates a package budget to $50,000 (daily spend = $1,667)
**Then** the system rejects with `budget_limit_exceeded`
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-012 (INV-2: daily budget > max)
**Priority** P1

#### Scenario: Currency limit passes when max not configured
**Obligation ID** UC-003-MAIN-06
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a media buy and a tenant with no `max_daily_package_spend` configured
**When** the buyer updates a package budget to any positive amount
**Then** the daily spend check is skipped; update proceeds
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-012 (INV-3: no max configured = check skipped)
**Priority** P2

#### Scenario: Adapter called with correct action for package budget
**Obligation ID** UC-003-MAIN-07
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a valid package budget update request that passes all validation
**When** the system processes the update
**Then** the adapter `update_media_buy()` is called with action `update_package_budget`, the correct `package_id`, and the new budget
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-020 (adapter atomicity)
**Priority** P1

#### Scenario: Database persisted after successful adapter call
**Obligation ID** UC-003-MAIN-08
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a valid package budget update where the adapter returns success
**When** the adapter call completes successfully
**Then** the `MediaPackage` record and `package_config` are updated with the new budget
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-020 (INV-1: adapter success = records persisted)
**Priority** P1

#### Scenario: Response includes affected_packages array
**Obligation ID** UC-003-MAIN-09
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a successful package budget update
**When** the system returns the success response
**Then** the `affected_packages` array contains the updated package with its current state
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-018 (atomic response: success fields present, no errors)
**Priority** P1

#### Scenario: Response wrapped in protocol envelope with status completed
**Obligation ID** UC-003-MAIN-10
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a successful auto-applied update
**When** the system returns the response
**Then** the protocol envelope has `status: completed` and the response body contains success data without error fields
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-018 (INV-1: success = no errors field)
**Priority** P1

#### Scenario: buyer_campaign_ref preserved in response [3.6 UPGRADE]
**Obligation ID** UC-003-MAIN-11
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a media buy that was created with a `buyer_campaign_ref`
**When** the update succeeds and the response is serialized
**Then** the `buyer_ref` field in the response matches the original `buyer_campaign_ref` value
**Business Rule** salesagent-7gnv (boundary drops fields)
**Priority** P0 -- upgrade regression

#### Scenario: ext fields preserved in request/response roundtrip [3.6 UPGRADE]
**Obligation ID** UC-003-MAIN-12
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a media buy with `ext` extension fields
**When** an update request includes or the response returns `ext` data
**Then** the `ext` fields are preserved without data loss through serialization/deserialization
**Business Rule** salesagent-7gnv (boundary drops fields)
**Priority** P0 -- upgrade regression

**When** the buyer updates end_time to shorten the flight to 15 days (daily=$2,000)
**Then** the system rejects with `budget_limit_exceeded` because daily spend ($2,000) > max ($1,500)
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-012 (daily spend recalculation on timing change)
**Priority** P1

#### Scenario: Timing update does NOT sync to ad server (known gap G35)
**Obligation ID** UC-003-ALT-UPDATE-TIMING-05
**Layer** behavioral
