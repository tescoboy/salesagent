## 3.6 Upgrade Impact

**CRITICAL.** This use case is directly affected by bug **salesagent-goy2**: Creative extends the WRONG adcp base class.

### Bug: salesagent-goy2 -- Creative Wrong Base Class

**Current state:** `salesagent.schemas.Creative` extends `adcp.types.Creative` which resolves to `adcp.types.generated_poc.creative.get_creative_delivery_response.Creative` (the **delivery** Creative).

**Correct base class:** The listing Creative at `adcp.types.generated_poc.media_buy.list_creatives_response.Creative` which has 13 fields:
- `account`, `assets`, `assignments`, `catalogs`, `created_date`, `creative_id`, `format_id`, `name`, `performance`, `status`, `sub_assets`, `tags`, `updated_date`

**Wrong base class (currently used):** The delivery Creative has only 6 fields:
- `creative_id`, `format_id`, `media_buy_id`, `totals`, `variant_count`, `variants`

**Consequences:**
1. **4 required fields stripped** from every `list_creatives` response: `name`, `status`, `created_date`, `updated_date` -- these are marked `exclude=True` in salesagent's Creative to work around the wrong base class, but they are REQUIRED fields in the listing Creative schema
2. **`variants=[]` hardcoded** to satisfy the wrong base class's required `variants` field -- the listing Creative has no `variants` field at all
3. **Every `list_creatives` response violates the AdCP schema** -- buyers expecting listing Creative fields get delivery Creative fields
4. **Fields that SHOULD be in the response** (from listing Creative): `assignments`, `performance`, `status_summary`, `account`, `catalogs`, `sub_assets`
5. **Fields that SHOULD NOT be in the response** (from delivery Creative): `variants`, `variant_count`, `totals`, `media_buy_id`

### Bug: salesagent-mq3n -- PricingOption delivery lookup

PricingOption uses string vs integer PK for delivery lookups. Not directly in UC-006 scope but affects downstream delivery after creative assignment.

### Bug: salesagent-7gnv -- MediaBuy boundary drops fields

MediaBuy boundary layer drops fields during serialization. Affects media buy status transitions triggered by creative assignments (BR-RULE-040).

### Upgrade test priorities for this UC:
- **P0**: Creative schema compliance -- verify Creative extends correct listing base class with all 13 fields
- **P0**: list_creatives response includes `name`, `status`, `created_date`, `updated_date` (currently stripped)
- **P0**: list_creatives response does NOT include `variants`, `variant_count` from delivery Creative
- **P1**: SyncCreativesRequest/Response schema compliance with 3.6.0
- **P1**: CreativeAsset schema validation against 3.6.0 core schema
- **P1**: CreativeAction enum values match 3.6.0 (created, updated, unchanged, failed, deleted)
- **P2**: Async response schemas (submitted/working/input-required) match 3.6.0

## Test Scenarios

### Main Flow (MCP): Sync Creatives via MCP Tool

Source: BR-UC-006-main-mcp.md

#### Scenario: Single static creative created successfully
**Obligation ID** UC-006-MAIN-MCP-01
**Layer** behavioral

**Given** the Buyer is authenticated with a valid principal_id
**And** the tenant exists and is resolvable from MCP session
**And** at least one creative agent is registered and reachable
**When** the Buyer invokes `sync_creatives` with one creative having a valid name, format_id, and assets
**Then** the response contains one creative result with `action=created`
**And** the creative is persisted in the database
**And** POST-S1 is satisfied: Buyer knows the creative was created
**And** POST-S2 is satisfied: action=created is reported
**Priority** P0 -- core happy path

#### Scenario: Multiple static creatives created in batch
**Obligation ID** UC-006-MAIN-MCP-02
**Layer** behavioral

**Given** the Buyer is authenticated
**And** the tenant exists
**When** the Buyer invokes `sync_creatives` with 5 valid creatives
**Then** the response contains 5 creative results, each with `action=created`
**And** all 5 creatives are persisted in the database
**Priority** P1 -- batch processing

#### Scenario: Existing creative updated (upsert by triple key)
**Obligation ID** UC-006-MAIN-MCP-03
**Layer** behavioral

**Given** the Buyer is authenticated with principal_id "P1"
**And** a creative with creative_id "C1" already exists for tenant "T1" and principal "P1"
**When** the Buyer invokes `sync_creatives` with creative_id "C1" and modified assets
**Then** the response contains one result with `action=updated`
**And** the existing creative's data is updated in the database
**Business Rule** BR-3: Existing creatives matched by tenant_id + principal_id + creative_id
**Priority** P1 -- upsert semantics

#### Scenario: Unchanged creative detection
**Obligation ID** UC-006-MAIN-MCP-04
**Layer** behavioral

**Given** a creative with creative_id "C1" exists with identical data
**When** the Buyer invokes `sync_creatives` with the same creative_id and identical content
**Then** the response contains one result with `action=unchanged`
**And** the database record is NOT modified
**Priority** P2 -- idempotency

#### Scenario: Per-creative savepoint isolation (lenient mode)
**Obligation ID** UC-006-MAIN-MCP-05
**Layer** behavioral

**Given** the Buyer sends 3 creatives: valid, invalid (bad format), valid
**And** validation_mode is lenient
**When** the system processes the batch
**Then** creative 1 gets `action=created`
**And** creative 2 gets `action=failed` with errors
**And** creative 3 gets `action=created` (NOT aborted by creative 2's failure)
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-033 INV-1: Per-creative failures are independent; other creatives continue
**Priority** P0 -- partial success

#### Scenario: Strict mode aborts on assignment error
**Obligation ID** UC-006-MAIN-MCP-06
**Layer** behavioral

**Given** the Buyer sends 2 creatives with assignments
**And** validation_mode is strict (default)
**And** the first assignment references a non-existent package
**When** the system processes assignments
**Then** a ToolError is raised
**And** all remaining assignments are aborted
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-033 INV-2: Strict mode aborts on assignment error
**Priority** P1 -- strict mode semantics

#### Scenario: Lenient mode continues on assignment error
**Obligation ID** UC-006-MAIN-MCP-07
**Layer** behavioral

**Given** the Buyer sends 2 creatives with assignments
**And** validation_mode is lenient
**And** the first assignment references a non-existent package
**When** the system processes assignments
**Then** the first assignment is recorded in `assignment_errors`
**And** the second assignment is processed normally
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-033 INV-3: Lenient mode logs warnings and continues
**Priority** P1 -- lenient mode semantics

#### Scenario: Default validation_mode is strict
**Obligation ID** UC-006-MAIN-MCP-08
**Layer** schema

**Given** the Buyer invokes `sync_creatives` without specifying validation_mode
**When** the system checks the validation_mode
**Then** it defaults to `strict`
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-033 INV-5: Default is strict
**Priority** P1 -- default contract

#### Scenario: Format registry pre-fetched once per sync operation
**Obligation ID** UC-006-MAIN-MCP-09
**Layer** behavioral

**Given** the Buyer sends multiple creatives referencing different formats
**When** the system processes the batch
**Then** the creative agent format registry is fetched once (step 4) and reused for all creatives
**And** individual creative validation does not trigger separate registry fetches
**Business Rule** Step 4: Format registry cached for duration of sync
**Priority** P2 -- performance optimization

#### Scenario: MCP response is valid SyncCreativesResponse
**Obligation ID** UC-006-MAIN-MCP-10
**Layer** behavioral

**Given** the Buyer invokes `sync_creatives` via MCP
**When** the system returns results
**Then** the MCP response contains a valid `SyncCreativesResponse` with per-creative results
**And** the response is parseable as JSON
**And** POST-S1, POST-S2 are satisfied
**Priority** P0 -- protocol correctness

**When** the Buyer sends `sync_creatives` task via A2A protocol
**Then** the A2A task response contains a valid `SyncCreativesResponse` payload
**And** per-creative results are included
**Priority** P1 -- REST happy path

#### Scenario: Slack notification for require-human approval (REST)
**Obligation ID** UC-006-MAIN-REST-02
**Layer** behavioral

**Given** the tenant has `approval_mode=require-human` and a configured `slack_webhook_url`
**When** the Buyer syncs creatives via A2A
**Then** Slack notification is sent immediately for creatives needing approval
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-037 INV-3
**Priority** P2 -- notification integration

#### Scenario: AI review submission for ai-powered approval (REST)
**Obligation ID** UC-006-MAIN-REST-03
**Layer** behavioral

**Given** the tenant has `approval_mode=ai-powered`

**Obligation ID** UC-006-CREATIVE-SCHEMA-COMPLIANCE-01
**Layer** schema

**Given** the salesagent `Creative` class in `src/core/schemas.py`
**When** inspected for its base class lineage
**Then** it extends the listing Creative (from `list_creatives_response`) NOT the delivery Creative (from `get_creative_delivery_response`)
**And** the listing Creative has fields: `account`, `assets`, `assignments`, `catalogs`, `created_date`, `creative_id`, `format_id`, `name`, `performance`, `status`, `sub_assets`, `tags`, `updated_date`

#### Scenario: list_creatives response does NOT include delivery-only fields (P0)
**Obligation ID** UC-006-CREATIVE-SCHEMA-COMPLIANCE-06
**Layer** schema

**Given** creatives exist in the database
**When** `list_creatives` is called and the response is serialized
**Then** the serialized creative does NOT contain `variants` field
**And** does NOT contain `variant_count` field
**And** does NOT contain `totals` field
**And** does NOT contain `media_buy_id` field (unless the listing schema includes it)
**Business Rule** Delivery Creative fields should not leak into listing response
**Priority** P0 -- 3.6 schema correctness

#### Scenario: Creative model_dump produces listing-schema-compliant JSON
**Obligation ID** UC-006-CREATIVE-SCHEMA-COMPLIANCE-07
**Layer** schema

**Given** a fully populated Creative instance
**When** `model_dump()` is called

**And** no delivery-only fields are included
**Priority** P0 -- schema contract (adcp compliance test)

#### Scenario: SyncCreativesResponse conforms to adcp 3.6.0 schema
**Obligation ID** UC-006-CREATIVE-SCHEMA-COMPLIANCE-08
**Layer** behavioral

**Given** a sync operation completes with mixed results (created, updated, failed)
**When** the response is serialized
**Then** the output validates against adcp 3.6.0 `sync-creatives-response.json` schema
**And** uses the discriminated union correctly (success variant vs error variant)
**Priority** P0 -- response schema compliance

#### Scenario: CreativeAction enum values match 3.6.0
**Obligation ID** UC-006-CREATIVE-SCHEMA-COMPLIANCE-09
**Layer** schema

**Given** the system reports creative actions
**When** any action is serialized

**And** these match the adcp 3.6.0 `creative-action.json` enum
**Priority** P1 -- enum compliance

#### Scenario: CreativeAsset schema accepts all 11 asset types
**Obligation ID** UC-006-CREATIVE-SCHEMA-COMPLIANCE-10
**Layer** behavioral
