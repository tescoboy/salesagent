New optional fields: channels, catalog_match, catalog_types, conversion_tracking, data_provider_signals, forecast, signal_targeting_allowed.
**Scenario:**
```gherkin
Given a product with all required fields populated
When serialized to AdCP schema
Then all required fields are present and extra fields are allowed

Given a product with new v3 field channels=["display", "olv"]
When serialized to AdCP schema
Then channels array is included with uniqueItems enforcement
```
**Priority:** P0
**Affected by 3.6:** Yes -- additional_properties changed, 6+ new fields

---

### pricing-option: Pricing Option Entity Schema
**Obligation ID** CONSTR-PRICING-OPTION-01

When validated against the v3 schema
Then the option is valid with the cpm sub-schema applied

Given a pricing option with delivery field as integer
When processed in v3
Then the system must handle the delivery field as an object reference, not integer PK
```
**Priority:** P0

**Priority:** P1
**Affected by 3.6:** Yes -- additional_properties changed

---

### targeting_overlay: Targeting Overlay Validation
