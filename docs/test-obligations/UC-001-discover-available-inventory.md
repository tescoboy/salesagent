# UC-001: Discover Available Inventory -- Test Obligations

## Source
- Requirements: `/Users/konst/projects/adcp-req/docs/requirements/use-cases/UC-001-discover-available-inventory/`
- Use Case ID: BR-UC-001
- Business Rules: BR-RULE-001 through BR-RULE-007

## 3.6 Upgrade Impact

### salesagent-qo8a (FIXED): 6 Product fields missing from DB
The Product schema in adcp 3.6.0 added 6 fields that were not persisted in the salesagent database:
- `catalog_match` -- catalog matching configuration
- `catalog_types` -- catalog type classifications
- `conversion_tracking` -- conversion tracking configuration
- `data_provider_signals` -- data provider signal definitions
- `forecast` -- delivery forecast data
- `signal_targeting_allowed` -- whether signal targeting is allowed

These fields are now present in the DB model (`src/core/database/models.py`) and populated during product conversion (`src/core/product_conversion.py`). Every scenario that returns products must verify these fields are present in the response when set on the product.

### salesagent-goy2: Creative extends wrong adcp type
Not directly impacting UC-001 (discovery), but if proposal allocations reference creative formats, the wrong base type could strip fields. Indirect risk during proposal generation.

### salesagent-mq3n: PricingOption delivery lookup string vs integer PK
Affects UC-001 at step 17 (adapter support annotation) and any filter that relies on pricing option lookup. The comparison of string pricing model name against integer PK will cause lookup failures, potentially marking all pricing options as unsupported.

### salesagent-7gnv: MediaBuy boundary drops fields
Not directly impacting UC-001 (discovery is read-only), but proposals generated in UC-001 feed into UC-002 (create media buy). If buyer_campaign_ref, creative_deadline, or ext are lost at the boundary, proposals that reference these will silently fail downstream.

### Filter Fields Impact
The new `signal_targeting` filter requires `signal_targeting_allowed` and `data_provider_signals` to be present on products. The `forecast` field is needed for `min_exposures` filter evaluation on guaranteed products. Without the qo8a fix, these filters would silently return empty results.

**Obligation ID** UC-001-BR-PRICINGOPTION-XOR-CONSTRAINT-01
**Layer** schema
**Given** a pricing option has `fixed_price` set and `floor_price` is null
**When** the system validates the pricing option
**Then** the pricing option is valid
**Business Rule:** BR-RULE-006 (INV-1)
**Priority:** P0

#### Scenario: Valid pricing option -- floor_price only
**Obligation ID** UC-001-BR-PRICINGOPTION-XOR-CONSTRAINT-02
**Layer** schema
**Given** a pricing option has `floor_price` set and `fixed_price` is null
**When** the system validates the pricing option
**Then** the pricing option is valid
**Business Rule:** BR-RULE-006 (INV-2)
**Priority:** P0

#### Scenario: Invalid pricing option -- both fixed_price and floor_price set
**Obligation ID** UC-001-BR-PRICINGOPTION-XOR-CONSTRAINT-03
**Layer** schema
**Given** a pricing option has both `fixed_price` and `floor_price` set
**When** the system validates the pricing option
**Then** the pricing option is invalid
**Business Rule:** BR-RULE-006 (INV-3)
**Priority:** P0

#### Scenario: Invalid pricing option -- neither fixed_price nor floor_price set
**Obligation ID** UC-001-BR-PRICINGOPTION-XOR-CONSTRAINT-04
**Layer** schema
**Given** a pricing option has neither `fixed_price` nor `floor_price` set
**When** the system validates the pricing option
**Then** the pricing option is invalid
**Business Rule:** BR-RULE-006 (INV-4)
**Priority:** P0

#### Scenario: CPA pricing model -- always fixed_price (model-specific)
**Obligation ID** UC-001-BR-PRICINGOPTION-XOR-CONSTRAINT-05
**Layer** schema
**Given** a pricing option uses the `cpa` model
**When** the system validates the pricing option
**Then** the pricing option is valid because CPA always has `fixed_price` (schema-enforced)
**And** the XOR check does not reject it
**Business Rule:** BR-RULE-006 (CPA note)
**Priority:** P1

### Business Rule: Product Schema Validity (BR-RULE-007)

#### Scenario: Product with all required arrays populated
**Obligation ID** UC-001-BR-PRODUCT-SCHEMA-VALIDITY-01
**Layer** schema
**Given** a product has format_ids: ["display_300x250"], publisher_properties: [{...}], pricing_options: [{...}]
**When** the system converts it to AdCP schema
**Then** conversion succeeds
**Business Rule:** BR-RULE-007 (INV-1)
**Priority:** P0

#### Scenario: Product conversion failure is fatal
**Obligation ID** UC-001-BR-PRODUCT-SCHEMA-VALIDITY-02
**Layer** schema
**Given** a product fails AdCP schema conversion (e.g., 0 format_ids)
**When** the system processes the get_products request
**Then** the entire request fails (not just that product)
**And** the error indicates data corruption
**Business Rule:** BR-RULE-007
**Priority:** P0

### Product Response Schema Completeness (3.6 Upgrade)

#### Scenario: Product response includes all mandatory AdCP fields
**Obligation ID** UC-001-PRODUCT-RESPONSE-SCHEMA-01
**Layer** schema
**Given** a product is returned in the response
**When** the product is serialized
**Then** it includes all required AdCP fields: `product_id`, `name`, `description`, `delivery_type`, `format_ids`, `publisher_properties`, `pricing_options`
**Priority:** P0

#### Scenario: Product response includes new 3.6 optional fields when populated
**Obligation ID** UC-001-PRODUCT-RESPONSE-SCHEMA-02
**Layer** schema
**Given** a product has the following fields populated in the database:
  - `catalog_match`
  - `catalog_types`
  - `conversion_tracking`
  - `data_provider_signals`
  - `forecast`
  - `signal_targeting_allowed`
**When** the product is serialized in the response
**Then** all 6 fields are present in the serialized product
**Priority:** P0

#### Scenario: Product response omits 3.6 optional fields when not populated
**Obligation ID** UC-001-PRODUCT-RESPONSE-SCHEMA-03
**Layer** schema
**Given** a product has none of the 6 new fields populated
**When** the product is serialized in the response
**Then** the serialized product either omits the fields or includes them as null
**And** the serialization is valid per the AdCP product schema
**Priority:** P1

#### Scenario: Roundtrip -- DB model to AdCP schema to response preserves all fields
**Obligation ID** UC-001-PRODUCT-RESPONSE-SCHEMA-04
**Layer** schema
**Given** a product is created in the database with all 6 new fields populated
**When** the product goes through: DB model -> product_conversion -> Product schema -> model_dump -> JSON response
**Then** all field values are preserved exactly through the entire roundtrip
**Priority:** P0

### Postcondition Verification

#### Scenario: POST-S1 -- Buyer knows what matches
**Obligation ID** UC-001-POST-01
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a successful get_products response
**When** the buyer examines the response
**Then** the `products[]` array contains all matching products (may be empty)
**Priority:** P0

#### Scenario: POST-S2 -- Buyer can evaluate pricing, formats, and delivery
**Obligation ID** UC-001-POST-02
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** an authenticated successful get_products response with products
**When** the buyer examines each product
**Then** each product has `pricing_options` (non-empty for authenticated), `format_ids`, `publisher_properties`, and `delivery_type`
**Priority:** P0

#### Scenario: POST-S3 -- Products ordered by relevance when brief provided
**Obligation ID** UC-001-POST-03
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a successful get_products response with brief provided

#### Scenario: POST-S4 -- Buyer only sees authorized products
**Obligation ID** UC-001-POST-04
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a successful get_products response
**When** the buyer examines the products
**Then** no product with `allowed_principal_ids` excluding the buyer's principal is visible

**Priority:** P1

#### Scenario: POST-S7 -- Buyer knows pagination state
**Obligation ID** UC-001-POST-07
**Layer** schema
**Given** a paginated response
**When** the buyer examines the pagination metadata
**Then** `has_more` indicates if more pages exist
**And** `cursor` is provided when `has_more` is true
**Priority:** P1

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### NFR-001: Security Hardening
- Authentication credentials are validated at request entry
- Brand manifest policy is enforced before catalog access
- Access control filters restrict product visibility per principal
- Property list agent URLs are validated before external fetch

### NFR-002: Prompt Injection Defense
- Policy LLM check (step 5) must be resistant to prompt injection in the brief
- Signals agent queries (step 11) must sanitize brief text
- Ranking LLM (step 16) must be resistant to injection in brief or product descriptions

### NFR-003: Audit and Logging
- All policy check decisions are logged (allowed, blocked, restricted, failed)
- Authentication decisions are logged
- The full pipeline produces an audit trail

### NFR-004: Response Latency SLAs
- LLM calls (policy check, ranking) have latency budgets
- Property list agent calls have timeout limits
- Signals agent queries have timeout limits

## Buying Mode Contract (AdCP 3.0 three-mode discovery)

The AdCP 3.0 spec defines three buyer-intent modes — `brief`, `wholesale`, `refine` —
that gate which response surface a get_products call produces. The seven cross-mode
invariants are encoded as a Pydantic `model_validator(mode="after")` on the local
`GetProductsRequest`. Pre-v3 clients without `buying_mode` are defaulted to `brief`
at the transport boundary per spec ("Sellers receiving requests from pre-v3 clients
without buying_mode SHOULD default to 'brief'").

#### Scenario: Brief mode runs the AI ranker and surfaces brief_relevance (T-UC-001-main)
**Obligation ID** UC-001-MODE-BRIEF-01
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a tenant with at least one product and AI ranking configured
**When** the Buyer Agent sends a get_products request with `buying_mode="brief"` and a non-empty `brief`
**Then** the response contains a `products` array
**And** each product surfaces `brief_relevance` populated from the ranker's reasoning
**And** the response does NOT contain `refinement_applied`
**Business Rule** AdCP 3.0 brief mode: "publisher curates product recommendations from the provided brief"
**Priority:** P0 -- core happy path for AdCP 3.0 v3 clients

#### Scenario: Wholesale mode bypasses the ranker and omits brief_relevance (T-UC-001-alt-wholesale)
**Obligation ID** UC-001-MODE-WHOLESALE-01
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a tenant with at least one product
**When** the Buyer Agent sends a get_products request with `buying_mode="wholesale"` and no `brief`
**Then** the response contains a `products` array in catalog order
**And** no product has `brief_relevance` set (the ranker is bypassed)
**And** the response does NOT contain `refinement_applied`
**Business Rule** AdCP 3.0 wholesale mode: "buyer requests raw inventory to apply their own audiences — brief must not be provided, and proposals are omitted"
**Priority:** P0 -- spec-defined alternative path

#### Scenario: Refine mode returns refinement_applied with status='unable' until #1073 (T-UC-001-alt-refine)
**Obligation ID** UC-001-MODE-REFINE-01
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a tenant with at least one product
**When** the Buyer Agent sends a get_products request with `buying_mode="refine"` and a non-empty `refine` array
**Then** the response contains a `products` array
**And** the response contains a `refinement_applied` array of the same length and order as the request `refine` array
**And** every `refinement_applied` entry reports `status="unable"` with notes referencing #1073
**And** product-scope and proposal-scope entries echo their id (rendered as `product_id` / `proposal_id` per spec 3.0.6 wire format)
**Business Rule** AdCP 3.0 refine mode: "iterate on products and proposals from a previous get_products response using the refine array of change requests"
**Note** The `unable` status reflects that proposal-state persistence is tracked separately in #1073; refinement_applied is the protocol-conformant minimum that satisfies storyboard schema validation today
**Priority:** P0 -- storyboard compliance gate (#1247 item 5)

#### Scenario: Cross-mode invariants are enforced (T-UC-001-ext-d)
**Obligation ID** UC-001-MODE-VALIDATION-01
**Layer** schema
**Given** the seven cross-mode rule rows in BR-UC-001-discover-available-inventory.feature:313-319
**When** the Buyer Agent sends a get_products request that violates a cross-mode invariant
**Then** the request is rejected with `error_code="VALIDATION_ERROR"` (UPPER_SNAKE per AdCP spec)
**And** the error message identifies the offending field and the active mode
**Business Rule** AdCP 3.0 cross-mode rules: brief required in brief mode; brief and refine forbidden in wholesale; brief forbidden and refine required in refine mode; v3 clients MUST include buying_mode
**Priority:** P0 -- contract enforcement

## Open Questions (from Gap Register)

These may generate additional test scenarios once resolved:

| ID | Question | Impact on Tests |
|----|----------|-----------------|
| G5 | AI ranking threshold 0.1 -- configurable per tenant? | If yes, need parameterized threshold tests |
| G7 | Dynamic product variant TTL semantics? | Need tests for expired variant references |
| G8 | Empty request returns all products -- intentional? | Need explicit test confirming this behavior |
| G25 | When does seller include proposals? | Need tests for proposal generation trigger conditions |
| G26 | Proposal expires between get_products and create_media_buy? | Cross-use-case test (UC-001 -> UC-002) |
| G27 | Invalid/expired pagination cursor behavior? | Need error handling tests for cursors |
| G28 | External property list fetch -- caching, error handling? | Need tests for unreachable agent_url |
| G29 | product_selectors reference items not in brand manifest? | Need tests for catalog miss scenarios |
