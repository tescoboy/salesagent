## 3.6 Upgrade Impact

### salesagent-mq3n: PricingOption delivery lookup compares string to integer PK -- CRITICAL
- **ROOT CAUSE**: When delivery metrics are fetched, the code looks up `pricing_option_id` (a string like `"cpm_usd_fixed"`) to match it to a PricingOption database record whose PK is an integer. This comparison always fails silently, meaning delivery metrics are never correctly associated with their pricing context.
- **Impact scope**: Main flow step 8 (assembling per-media-buy delivery metrics requires pricing context to compute spend, effective_rate, etc.), package-level breakdowns (step 9), and aggregated totals (step 10).
- **Test obligation**: Every delivery metrics test must verify that `pricing_option_id` lookup uses the correct type -- string identifier, not integer PK. The lookup must resolve through the string `pricing_option_id` field, not the integer primary key.
- **Regression tests needed**:
  1. PricingOption lookup in delivery path uses string `pricing_option_id` field (not integer PK)
  2. Delivery metrics correctly include spend data (which requires successful pricing lookup)
  3. Package-level delivery status correctly reflects pricing model (CPM vs CPC vs FLAT_RATE compute differently)
  4. End-to-end: create media buy with pricing -> fetch delivery -> verify pricing_option_id round-trips correctly

### salesagent-7gnv: MediaBuy boundary drops buyer_campaign_ref, creative_deadline, ext fields
- **MODERATE for UC-004**: Delivery responses reference media buy identifiers including `buyer_ref`. If `buyer_campaign_ref` is dropped during serialization, the delivery response will have missing identification data, making it impossible for the buyer to correlate delivery data with their own campaign references.
- **Test obligation**: Verify `buyer_ref` / `buyer_campaign_ref` is present in `media_buy_deliveries[]` entries.

### salesagent-goy2: Creative extends wrong adcp type
- **LOW for UC-004**: Creative-level breakdowns are in the schema (G44) but not currently populated by code. If creative-level delivery is implemented in 3.6, the wrong base type would cause issues.
- **Test obligation**: If creative-level breakdowns are populated, verify creative model compatibility.

### Schema changes in adcp 3.6
- `GetMediaBuyDeliveryRequest` extends `LibraryGetMediaBuyDeliveryRequest` -- verify the library base class fields match expectations.
- `GetMediaBuyDeliveryResponse` extends `LibraryGetMediaBuyDeliveryResponse` with `NestedModelSerializerMixin` -- verify nested serialization of `media_buy_deliveries[]` and `aggregated_totals`.
- Delivery metrics fields (impressions, spend, clicks, ctr, video, conversions, viewability) -- verify schema compatibility with 3.6 `delivery-metrics.json`.

## Test Scenarios

### Main Flow: Polling Delivery Metrics
Source: BR-UC-004-main-mcp.md

#### Scenario: Happy path -- fetch delivery for single media buy by media_buy_id
**Obligation ID** UC-004-MAIN-01
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** an authenticated buyer who owns a media buy with active delivery data
**When** the buyer sends `get_media_buy_delivery` with `media_buy_ids: ["mb_123"]`
**Then** the system returns a success response in a protocol envelope with status `completed`, containing `reporting_period`, `currency`, `media_buy_deliveries` array with one entry, and optional `aggregated_totals`

**Business Rule** POST-F2 (buyer knows delivery data could not be retrieved)
**Priority** P1

#### Scenario: Adapter returns internal error
**Obligation ID** UC-004-EXT-F-02
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** valid request with authenticated buyer
**When** the ad server adapter returns a 500 internal server error
**Then** the system returns error `adapter_error`
**Business Rule** Ext-f step 7b
**Priority** P2

#### Scenario: Adapter failure logged to audit trail
**Obligation ID** UC-004-EXT-F-03
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** an adapter failure
**When** the error occurs
**Then** the adapter failure is logged to the audit trail (NFR-003)
**Business Rule** Ext-f step 7c
**Priority** P2

#### Scenario: State unchanged on adapter error
**Obligation ID** UC-004-EXT-F-04
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** an adapter error
**When** the error is returned
**Then** no state is modified (read-only operation)
**Business Rule** POST-F1

### Extension *g: Webhook Delivery Failure
Source: BR-UC-004-ext-g.md

#### Scenario: Transient failure -- 5xx triggers retry with exponential backoff
**Obligation ID** UC-004-EXT-G-01
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a webhook endpoint that returns 503
**When** the first delivery attempt fails
**Then** the system retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s + jitter)
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-029 (INV-3: 5xx/network = retry with backoff)
**Priority** P1

#### Scenario: Retry succeeds on second attempt
**Obligation ID** UC-004-EXT-G-02
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a webhook endpoint that fails on first attempt but succeeds on second
**When** the retry fires
**Then** the delivery is recorded as successful
**Business Rule** Ext-g transient flow step 8d
**Priority** P2

#### Scenario: All retries exhausted -- circuit breaker opens
**Obligation ID** UC-004-EXT-G-03
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a webhook endpoint that fails 3 consecutive times
**When** all retry attempts are exhausted
**Then** the circuit breaker opens for this endpoint, the delivery is marked `reporting_delayed`, and subsequent deliveries are suppressed
**Business Rule** Ext-g persistent flow steps 8c-8e
**Priority** P1

#### Scenario: Circuit breaker half-open probe
**Obligation ID** UC-004-EXT-G-04
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** an open circuit breaker for a webhook endpoint
**When** the circuit breaker timer fires
**Then** the system attempts a half-open probe to check endpoint recovery
**Business Rule** Ext-g persistent flow step 8f
**Priority** P2

#### Scenario: 4xx error -- no retry (client error)
**Obligation ID** UC-004-EXT-G-05
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a webhook endpoint that returns 401 Forbidden
**When** the delivery attempt fails
**Then** the system does NOT retry (authentication errors are not transient), marks webhook as failed
**Business Rule** BR-RULE-029 (INV-4: 4xx = no retry)
**Priority** P1

#### Scenario: 401/403 authentication rejection -- webhook marked failed
**Obligation ID** UC-004-EXT-G-06
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a webhook delivery where HMAC signature verification fails at the endpoint
**When** the endpoint returns 401/403
**Then** the system logs authentication rejection, does not retry, and marks the webhook as failed
**Business Rule** Ext-g auth flow steps 8c-8e
**Priority** P1

#### Scenario: Buyer must reconfigure credentials after auth rejection
**Obligation ID** UC-004-EXT-G-07
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a webhook marked as failed due to 401/403
**When** the buyer wants to resume webhook deliveries
**Then** the buyer must reconfigure webhook credentials via UC-003 (Update Media Buy)
**Business Rule** Ext-g recovery step 3
**Priority** P3 -- documentation

#### Scenario: Webhook failures do not produce synchronous error to buyer
**Obligation ID** UC-004-EXT-G-08
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a webhook delivery failure (any type)
**When** the failure occurs
**Then** there is no synchronous error response to the buyer (no request/response cycle); the buyer detects missing reports via sequence number gaps
**Business Rule** Ext-g postcondition note
**Priority** P2

## Cross-Cutting Concerns for 3.6 Upgrade

### PricingOption Type Consistency [salesagent-mq3n]

#### Scenario: PricingOption model has string pricing_option_id field accessible for lookup
**Obligation ID** UC-004-PRICINGOPTION-TYPE-CONSISTENCY-01
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** the PricingOption model in salesagent
**When** delivery code looks up a PricingOption by its identifier
**Then** the lookup uses the string `pricing_option_id` field (e.g., "cpm_usd_fixed"), NOT the integer primary key
**Business Rule** salesagent-mq3n
**Priority** P0 -- CRITICAL, blocks all delivery metrics

#### Scenario: PricingOption string-to-integer comparison detected and rejected
**Obligation ID** UC-004-PRICINGOPTION-TYPE-CONSISTENCY-02
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** code that compares `pricing_option_id` string to a database integer PK
**When** the comparison is evaluated
**Then** the comparison must be caught by a type check or unit test (never silently succeed/fail)
**Business Rule** salesagent-mq3n (silent data loss prevention)
**Priority** P0

#### Scenario: End-to-end delivery metrics with CPM pricing
**Obligation ID** UC-004-PRICINGOPTION-TYPE-CONSISTENCY-03
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a media buy created with CPM pricing option (string ID "cpm_usd_fixed"), 10,000 delivered impressions, rate $2.50 CPM
**When** `get_media_buy_delivery` is called
**Then** spend is correctly computed as $25.00, and the pricing option is correctly identified in the response
**Business Rule** salesagent-mq3n (end-to-end validation)
**Priority** P0

#### Scenario: End-to-end delivery metrics with CPC pricing
**Obligation ID** UC-004-PRICINGOPTION-TYPE-CONSISTENCY-04
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a media buy created with CPC pricing option, 500 clicks, rate $0.50 CPC
**When** `get_media_buy_delivery` is called
**Then** spend is correctly computed as $250.00, and the pricing option is correctly identified
**Business Rule** salesagent-mq3n
**Priority** P1

#### Scenario: End-to-end delivery metrics with FLAT_RATE pricing
**Obligation ID** UC-004-PRICINGOPTION-TYPE-CONSISTENCY-05
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a media buy created with FLAT_RATE pricing option, total rate $5,000
**When** `get_media_buy_delivery` is called
**Then** spend reflects the flat rate correctly
**Business Rule** salesagent-mq3n
**Priority** P1

### Response Serialization [salesagent-7gnv]

#### Scenario: GetMediaBuyDeliveryResponse nested serialization
**Obligation ID** UC-004-RESPONSE-SERIALIZATION-SALESAGENT-01
**Layer** schema
**Given** a delivery response with multiple media_buy_deliveries, each containing packages
**When** `model_dump()` is called on the response
**Then** all nested models (media_buy_deliveries, packages, delivery_metrics) are correctly serialized (NestedModelSerializerMixin applied)
**Business Rule** Critical pattern #4 (explicit nested serialization)
**Priority** P1

#### Scenario: Delivery response preserves ext fields
**Obligation ID** UC-004-RESPONSE-SERIALIZATION-SALESAGENT-02
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a media buy with extension fields in the delivery context
**When** the delivery response is serialized
**Then** `ext` fields are preserved in the output
**Business Rule** salesagent-7gnv
**Priority** P1

### Display Messages [salesagent-jz5z]

#### Scenario: GetMediaBuyDeliveryResponse __str__ returns human-readable summary
**Obligation ID** UC-004-DISPLAY-01
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a GetMediaBuyDeliveryResponse with zero, one, or many media buy deliveries
**When** `str()` is called on the response
**Then** the result is a human-readable summary message suitable for MCP protocol envelope content field
**Business Rule** Every MCP response has a clear human-readable summary
**Priority** P2

### Serialization Compliance [salesagent-jz5z]

#### Scenario: next_expected_at explicitly null when notification_type is set
**Obligation ID** UC-004-SERIAL-01
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a GetMediaBuyDeliveryResponse with notification_type set and next_expected_at not set
**When** `model_dump(mode='json')` is called
**Then** the output includes `next_expected_at: null` so consumers know no further reports are expected
**Business Rule** AdCP protocol requires explicit null for next_expected_at when notification_type is present
**Priority** P2
