## 3.6 Upgrade Impact

### salesagent-7gnv: MediaBuy Boundary Drops Fields

The adcp 3.6.0 library `CreateMediaBuyRequest` now includes fields that salesagent's MCP/A2A
boundary may not propagate to the adapter or persist in the database:

| Field | In adcp 3.6 Request | In adcp 3.6 Success Response | Impact |
|-------|---------------------|------------------------------|--------|
| `buyer_campaign_ref` | Yes (optional) | Yes (optional) | Request field accepted by Pydantic but not stored in DB `media_buys` table; retrieved from `raw_request` JSON on list. Response field exists on `AdCPCreateMediaBuySuccess` but adapters do not populate it. |
| `ext` | Yes (optional, `ExtensionObject`) | Yes (optional, `ExtensionObject`) | Accepted at boundary but not propagated through pipeline or stored. Round-trip broken: buyer sends ext, response has no ext. |
| `account_id` | Yes (optional) | No (response has `account` object) | Accepted at boundary but ignored in most validation. Not stored. Not propagated to response. |
| `creative_deadline` | No (request-side) | Yes (optional, `AwareDatetime`) | Adapters set `creative_deadline` on success response but salesagent boundary may not pass it through to the MCP/A2A caller. |
| `account` | No (request-side) | Yes (optional, `Account` object) | New in 3.6 response. Populated as a buyer-safe `{account_id, name, status}` projection when the request resolves an account (UC-002-UPG-07); seller financials are redacted by construction. |
| `sandbox` | No (request-side) | Yes (optional, `bool`) | New in 3.6 response. Populated `true` when the tenant is in sandbox mode, absent otherwise (UC-002-UPG-09). |

### salesagent-goy2: Creative Extends Wrong adcp Type

The salesagent `Creative` model may extend the wrong adcp base type, causing schema
mismatches when creatives are included in media buy requests or responses.

### salesagent-mq3n: PricingOption Delivery Lookup String vs Integer PK

When resolving `pricing_option_id` during step 9 (pricing validation), the system may
compare string IDs against integer primary keys, causing pricing options to never match
and all pricing lookups to fail.

### salesagent-qo8a: 6 Product Fields Missing from DB (FIXED)

Product fields added in adcp 3.6 now have database columns. This was already fixed.
Relevant to UC-002 because product lookups during validation (step 7) now include
these fields.

**Obligation ID** UC-002-UPG-01
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a `create_media_buy` request with `buyer_campaign_ref: "CAMP-2024-Q1"`
**When** the request is parsed by the system
**Then** the `buyer_campaign_ref` field is accepted (not rejected by validation)
**And** it is stored or propagated such that it can be returned in `list_media_buys`
**Business Rule:** (3.6 field propagation)
**Priority:** P1 (salesagent-7gnv)

#### Scenario: buyer_campaign_ref Roundtrip Through Create and List
**Obligation ID** UC-002-UPG-02
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a media buy created with `buyer_campaign_ref: "CAMP-2024-Q1"`

#### Scenario: account Field in Success Response
**Obligation ID** UC-002-UPG-07
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** the adcp 3.6 `CreateMediaBuySuccess` has an optional `account` field
**When** a media buy is created and the request resolves an account
**Then** the response includes a buyer-safe `account` projection containing only
`{account_id, name, status}` — seller financials are redacted by construction (never
set), and `status` uses the same wire projection as `get_accounts` (internal lifecycle
states map to spec `AccountStatus`, e.g. `pending_provision` → `pending_approval`, #332)
**Priority:** P2 (salesagent-7gnv)

#### Scenario: creative_deadline in Success Response
**Obligation ID** UC-002-UPG-08

### Cross-Cutting: Schema Compliance

#### Scenario: CreateMediaBuyRequest Accepts All adcp 3.6 Fields
**Obligation ID** UC-002-CC-SCHEMA-COMPLIANCE-01
**Layer** schema
**Given** a request with all adcp 3.6 fields: `account_id`, `artifact_webhook`, `brand`, `buyer_campaign_ref`, `buyer_ref`, `context`, `end_time`, `ext`, `packages`, `po_number`, `proposal_id`, `reporting_webhook`, `start_time`, `total_budget`
**When** the request is parsed by the salesagent `CreateMediaBuyRequest` model
**Then** all fields are accepted without validation errors
**Priority:** P0 (3.6 upgrade)

#### Scenario: CreateMediaBuySuccess Exposes All adcp 3.6 Response Fields
**Obligation ID** UC-002-CC-SCHEMA-COMPLIANCE-02
**Layer** schema
**Given** a successful media buy creation
**When** the response is serialized at the MCP boundary
**Then** the response schema includes: `account`, `buyer_campaign_ref`, `buyer_ref`, `context`, `creative_deadline`, `ext`, `media_buy_id`, `packages`, `sandbox`
**Priority:** P1 (3.6 upgrade)

#### Scenario: PackageRequest Accepts All adcp 3.6 Fields
**Obligation ID** UC-002-CC-SCHEMA-COMPLIANCE-03
**Layer** schema
**Given** a package request with all adcp 3.6 fields: `bid_price`, `budget`, `buyer_ref`, `catalog`, `creative_assignments`, `creatives`, `ext`, `format_ids`, `impressions`, `optimization_goal`, `pacing`, `paused`, `pricing_option_id`, `product_id`, `targeting_overlay`
**When** the package is parsed
**Then** all fields are accepted without validation errors
**Priority:** P1 (3.6 upgrade)

### Postcondition Tests

#### Scenario: POST-F1 -- System State Unchanged on Any Failure
**Obligation ID** UC-002-POST-01
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** any validation or adapter failure
**When** the error response is returned
**Then** no media buy, package, or creative assignment records exist in the database
**And** no campaign exists in the ad server (unless ext-q partial execution)
**Business Rule:** POST-F1
**Priority:** P0

#### Scenario: POST-F2 -- Error Response Contains Specific Error Code
**Obligation ID** UC-002-POST-02
**Layer** schema
**Given** any failure
**When** the error response is returned
**Then** it contains a specific error code (not generic)
**And** the buyer can identify the exact failure
**Business Rule:** POST-F2
**Priority:** P0

#### Scenario: POST-F3 -- Error Response Contains Recovery Guidance
**Obligation ID** UC-002-POST-03
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** any validation failure
**When** the error response is returned
**Then** the message includes enough information for the buyer to fix and retry
**Business Rule:** POST-F3
**Priority:** P1

#### Scenario: POST-S2 -- Buyer Can Track via media_buy_id and buyer_ref
**Obligation ID** UC-002-POST-04
**Layer** behavioral
**Given** a successful media buy creation
**When** the response is returned
**Then** it includes both `media_buy_id` (publisher ID) and `buyer_ref` (buyer's ID)
**And** both can be used to query the media buy later
**Business Rule:** POST-S2
**Priority:** P0

### Shared Implementation Pattern (Critical Pattern #5)

#### Scenario: MCP and A2A Use Same Implementation
**Obligation ID** UC-002-SHARED-IMPLEMENTATION-PATTERN-01
**Layer** schema
**Given** the `create_media_buy` tool
**When** called via MCP (`@mcp.tool()`) or A2A (`create_media_buy_raw()`)
**Then** both paths call the same `_create_media_buy_impl()` function
**And** produce identical validation and responses
**Priority:** P1

## Priority Distribution

| Priority | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| P0 | ~45 | Must-have for 3.6 upgrade: auth, budget, product lookup, datetime, pricing, adapter atomicity, response semantics, boundary fields |
| P1 | ~65 | Important: targeting, creatives, formats, min/max spend, approval workflow, field propagation |
| P2 | ~25 | Moderate: edge cases, fallback chains, case sensitivity, implicit currency |
| P3 | ~6 | Nice-to-have: sandbox flag, cosmetic response details |

## Open Questions (from Requirements)

These gaps may require additional test scenarios once resolved:

- G9: Package schema requires only `package_id`, but code enforces 4 required fields
- G10: Budget > 0 in code vs >= 0 in schema (covered by ext-a scenario)
- G11: Single currency constraint -- protocol-level or implementation choice?
- G12: No duplicate product_ids -- protocol-level or implementation choice?
- G14: Format ID must be object -- schema allows string but code rejects
- G20: Reporting webhook frequency -- only daily supported
- G24: Creative update semantics -- replace or merge?
- G30: Can packages be provided alongside proposal_id for overrides?
- G31: What validation applies to proposal-derived packages?
- G32: Product from proposal removed between get_products and create_media_buy?
- G33: How does account_id interact with proposal execution?
