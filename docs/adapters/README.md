# Adapters

Adapters connect the Prebid Sales Agent to ad servers. Choose the adapter that matches your ad server platform.

## Available Adapters

### [Mock Adapter](mock/)

A simulated ad server for testing and development.

- No external dependencies
- Simulates all AdCP operations
- Configurable delivery simulation
- Ideal for evaluation and testing

[Get started with Mock](mock/)

### [FreeWheel](freewheel/)

## Adding a New Adapter

Building support for a new ad server? See the [adapter playbook](adding-a-new-adapter.md) —
a phase-by-phase checklist of every file you need to touch (registry, typed
API config, admin UI, migrations, repository, tests, docs) plus common
gotchas. FreeWheel is the reference implementation.

## Choosing an Adapter

| Adapter | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| **GAM** | Production deployments with Google Ad Manager |
| **FreeWheel** | Video + CTV inventory via Comcast/FreeWheel Publisher API |
| **Mock** | Testing, demos, development |

> Triton Digital is currently parked while their APIs aren't production-ready.
> Source remains under `src/adapters/triton/`; restoring is a one-commit revert.

## Multi-Tenant Considerations

In multi-tenant mode, each tenant can have their own adapter configuration:

- Different GAM network codes per tenant
- Mix of GAM and Mock adapters
- Per-tenant service accounts

See [Multi-Tenant Setup](../deployment/multi-tenant.md) for configuration details.
