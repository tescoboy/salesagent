# Sync Accounts → GAM Advertiser Mapping

## Problem

The salesagent's `sync_accounts` AdCP tool today is pure-internal: it upserts `Account` rows in our DB keyed by `(operator, brand.domain, brand.brand_id, sandbox)` and never touches the seller's ad server. When a buyer agent later calls `create_media_buy` for that account, the impl needs a `gam_advertiser_id` to attach the GAM Order to — but `Account.platform_mappings` is empty.

Today this works for Wonderstruck because there's exactly one advertiser per principal in `Principal.platform_mappings`, hard-coded by the publisher. That's the wrong shape for embedded mode where Scope3 will sync hundreds of (operator, brand) pairs and expect them to wire up to real GAM advertisers without manual ops work per pair.

This doc decides:
1. What the natural granularity is — when do two `(operator, brand)` calls produce one advertiser vs. two?
2. When does the salesagent provision a GAM advertiser, and when does it require manual ops?
3. Where do sandbox / dry-run flows fit?

## Granularity decision

The advertiser is the GAM `Company(type='ADVERTISER')` row that invoices appear under. The salesagent `Account` should be 1:1 with that billing entity.

| `Account.billing` | Natural key | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `operator` (default today) | `(operator, brand.domain, brand.brand_id, sandbox)` | Operator is invoiced. Different buyer agents pulling the same brand share one GAM advertiser — they're all selling into the same operator/brand relationship and the operator's books need one row per brand they're paid for. |
| `agent` | `(buyer_agent_principal_id, operator, brand.domain, brand.brand_id, sandbox)` | The buyer agent is invoiced. The buyer agent is the calling principal — `identity.principal_id` from the request's auth chain. Different buyer agents on the same `(operator, brand)` are different commercial relationships — different rate cards, commissions, audit trails. They MUST be different GAM advertisers so finance can split the books. |
| any with `sandbox=true` | route to a single per-tenant `__sandbox__` advertiser | Sandbox traffic must never bill, never appear in production reports, never count against publisher inventory caps. Keep all sandbox media buys against one synthetic advertiser the salesagent owns. |

**`account_scope` already encodes this** in our schema (`operator | brand | operator_brand | agent` — `models.py:875`). The natural key above maps onto it: agent-billed → `agent` scope, operator-billed → `operator_brand` scope, sandbox → ignore scope, route to sandbox bucket.

**Note on `governance_agents`:** that AdCP field is unrelated — it lists agents with audit/oversight authority over the Account (delegation), not the buyer agent in the billing relationship. The buyer agent for `billing=agent` is unambiguously the calling principal; there's no fallback question to resolve.

## Lifecycle

`sync_accounts` and `create_media_buy` split responsibilities. Sync records intent; first-buy provisions GAM.

### `sync_accounts` — record intent only

This stays a pure salesagent-internal upsert. Behavior unchanged from today's impl, with two additions:

1. **New status:** `pending_provision` joins the existing `(active | pending_approval | rejected | payment_required | suspended | closed)` enum (`models.py:863`). Means "we have an Account row, no GAM advertiser yet, waiting for a media buy or manual provision."

   New accounts created via sync land in:
   - `pending_approval` if tenant `account_approval_mode != 'auto'` (today's BR-RULE-060 path).
   - `pending_provision` if approval is auto AND tenant has GAM AND `Account.platform_mappings.gam_advertiser_id` is unset.
   - `active` only when there's a confirmed GAM advertiser id wired up.
   - Sandbox accounts: always `active` and immediately wired to the per-tenant sandbox advertiser (no provisioning step).

2. **Setup hint when in `pending_provision`:** the `setup` block on the response gets a `provision_url` pointing at an Admin UI page where the publisher can manually attach a GAM advertiser id (existing GAM advertiser picker — already in the Admin UI). For tenants with `auto_provision_advertisers=true`, the setup block can omit the URL since first-buy will trigger the create automatically.

`sync_accounts` STILL never calls GAM. This keeps GAM-advertiser cardinality bounded by actual buying activity — buyers exploring "do you support brand X?" via sync don't burn GAM rows.

### `create_media_buy` — provision-on-first-buy

When `_create_media_buy_impl` resolves an Account in `pending_provision`:

```python
account = repo.get(media_buy_request.account_id)
if account.status == "pending_provision":
    if account.sandbox:
        advertiser_id = ensure_sandbox_advertiser(tenant_id)  # cached per tenant
    elif tenant.auto_provision_advertisers:
        advertiser_id = gam.create_advertiser(name=account.name)  # CompanyService.createCompanies
        repo.attach_advertiser(account.account_id, advertiser_id)
        account.status = "active"
    else:
        raise AdCPError(
            "ACCOUNT_NOT_PROVISIONED",
            message=f"Account {account.account_id} has no GAM advertiser. "
                    "Publisher must map manually via Admin UI before this account "
                    "can buy media.",
            recovery="terminal",  # buyer can't resolve; ops must
        )
```

The `ACCOUNT_NOT_PROVISIONED` path is the conservative default — publishers with strong GAM-side ops governance keep `auto_provision_advertisers=false` and the salesagent files an approval workflow visible in the Admin UI. The `auto_provision_advertisers=true` path is for tenants who've delegated advertiser-create authority to the salesagent (Scope3-managed tenants will turn this on at provision time).

### `Tenant.auto_provision_advertisers`

New boolean column on `Tenant`. Default `false` for backward compatibility with today's open-instance tenants. The Tenant Management API's `POST /tenants/provision` accepts it as a request field (default `true` for embedded-mode tenants — Scope3 wants automation by default). Open-instance Admin UI exposes it as a config toggle on the GAM adapter page.

Migration: `add_auto_provision_advertisers_to_tenant` adds the column with `server_default='false'`.

## Storage

Use `Account.platform_mappings` (existing column, currently unused — `models.py:850`):

```json
{
  "google_ad_manager": {
    "advertiser_id": "1234567890",
    "advertiser_name": "Acme News × Coca-Cola (Scope3 BuyerAgent)",
    "provisioned_at": "2026-05-04T17:00:00Z",
    "provisioned_by": "auto" | "manual:user@operator.com"
  }
}
```

Don't reuse `Principal.platform_mappings` (line 559) for this. Principal mappings are agent-level credentials (e.g., the Wonderstruck single-advertiser today's hack); Account mappings are billing-entity-level. Mixing them collapses the granularity decision back to one-advertiser-per-agent.

The advertiser-name template is the only scaling concern: GAM enforces uniqueness on company names. Template should embed the agent + operator + brand to avoid collisions:

```
"{operator} × {brand_domain} ({agent_name})"  if billing=agent
"{operator} × {brand_domain}"                  if billing=operator
"{tenant_name} Sandbox"                        if sandbox
```

If creation fails with a name conflict (existing advertiser with the same template), the salesagent fetches the existing one's id and attaches it to the Account — same logical advertiser, no duplication.

## Sandbox

Sandbox accounts (`Account.sandbox=true`) NEVER get a real GAM advertiser. Behavior:

1. On first sync, salesagent ensures a per-tenant sandbox advertiser exists in GAM (created lazily on first sandbox account, reused thereafter). Stored on `AdapterConfig.gam_sandbox_advertiser_id`.
2. Every sandbox `Account.platform_mappings.advertiser_id` points at this single sandbox advertiser.
3. Sandbox media buys go to GAM but use `dry_run=true` (or whatever the GAM adapter calls it) so they create real Order rows but never serve. This keeps the buyer's storyboard exercising real GAM machinery without polluting production reports.
4. **Open question 2:** confirm GAM's dry-run semantics actually create rows that show in the publisher's UI but don't serve, vs. rejecting at the API layer. If they reject, sandbox needs a separate "test GAM network" entirely — out of scope for v1.

## Pre-mapping (Tenant Management API)

Publishers — and Scope3 driving them programmatically — need a way to wire GAM advertisers to billing keys *before* any buyer agent calls `sync_accounts`. Otherwise every first-buy on a new brand burns an `ACCOUNT_NOT_PROVISIONED` round trip even when the publisher already knows which advertiser belongs where.

The mapping IS the Account. We expose Account upsert through the Tenant Management API; pre-mapping is just creating Accounts ahead of time with `platform_mappings.gam_advertiser_id` pre-attached and `status=active`.

### `POST /api/v1/tenant-management/tenants/{tid}/accounts`

Upsert by the same natural key `_sync_accounts_impl` uses, with the GAM advertiser pre-attached:

```python
class CreateAccountRequest(BaseModel):
    name: str | None = None        # display name; auto-generated if omitted
    operator: str                  # required
    brand: BrandReference          # {domain, brand_id?}
    billing: Literal["operator", "agent"]
    buyer_agent_principal_id: str | None = None  # required iff billing=agent
    sandbox: bool = False
    gam_advertiser_id: str         # the whole point of this endpoint
    gam_advertiser_name: str | None = None  # optional cache for display
    payment_terms: str | None = None
    rate_card: str | None = None
```

Behavior:
1. Validate request — `billing=agent` requires `buyer_agent_principal_id`; `sandbox=true` rejects `gam_advertiser_id` (sandbox accounts route to the per-tenant sandbox advertiser, not a caller-specified one).
2. Look up by natural key. For `billing=operator|sandbox`: `(operator, brand_domain, brand_id, sandbox)`. For `billing=agent`: that key + `principal_id`.
3. **Upsert:** existing → update `platform_mappings.gam_advertiser_id`, flip `status=active` if it was `pending_provision`, return 200 with the updated Account. Missing → create with status=`active`, return 201.
4. Return the full `AccountDetail` either way.

When `sync_accounts` later comes in for the same natural key, the existing upsert finds the row, updates fields if anything drifted, leaves the advertiser id intact, and returns `unchanged` or `updated`. No `pending_provision` round trip.

### `GET /api/v1/tenant-management/tenants/{tid}/accounts`

List accounts for a tenant. Optional filters:
- `?operator=` — exact match
- `?billing=operator|agent` — filter by billing model
- `?advertiser_mapped=true|false` — has `platform_mappings.gam_advertiser_id` set?
- `?status=active|pending_provision|...`
- `?sandbox=true|false`

Returns `ListAccountsResponse` with `accounts: list[AccountSummary]` and a `count`.

### Why expose this and not `PATCH` / `DELETE` initially

POST handles upsert (create or remap an existing Account's advertiser id by re-POSTing). GET answers "what's the current state?" — these two cover the Storefront-driven workflow (push mappings, verify, re-push deltas). Explicit `PATCH /accounts/{id}` and `DELETE` (soft-close to `status=closed`) can land if the cardinality of repeated POST upserts becomes an audit-log nuisance, but they're not on the critical path.

### Tradeoff: exact-match vs. wildcards

This design requires one Account row per natural-key combination — no wildcards like "any agent on AccuWeather × cocacola.com → advertiser 12345." For `billing=operator` that's fine (one row per operator/brand). For `billing=agent` it's potentially N×M (every agent × every brand). Defer the wildcard question until Scope3 actually hits cardinality pain — then a separate `account_advertiser_rules` table can express patterns and `_sync_accounts_impl` consults it as a fallback when no exact-match Account exists.

## Migration plan

Three salesagent migrations + one schema bump:

1. `add_auto_provision_advertisers_to_tenant` — `Tenant.auto_provision_advertisers` boolean, default false. Migration only; no code path reads it yet.
2. `add_pending_provision_to_account_status` — extend the CHECK constraint on `Account.status` to include `pending_provision`. Existing rows unaffected.
3. `add_gam_sandbox_advertiser_id_to_adapter_config` — `AdapterConfig.gam_sandbox_advertiser_id` nullable string. Lazily populated.

Code changes:

1. `sync_accounts` impl — set new accounts to `pending_provision` when GAM is configured and no manual mapping exists. Sandbox accounts get the sandbox advertiser immediately.
2. `create_media_buy` impl — branch on Account status; provision-on-first-buy when `auto_provision_advertisers=true`; raise `ACCOUNT_NOT_PROVISIONED` otherwise.
3. `GAMOrdersManager.create_advertiser(name) -> str` — new helper. Calls `companyService.createCompanies([{name, type: 'ADVERTISER'}])`, returns the new id. Handles name-collision-as-attach (look up existing, return its id).
4. Admin UI — add a "Map advertiser" button on Account rows in `pending_provision` status. Calls a new endpoint `POST /admin/accounts/{id}/attach-advertiser` that takes a GAM advertiser id and attaches it.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `sync_accounts` with billing=operator → creates Account in `pending_provision` (or `pending_approval` per existing BR-RULE-060) with no GAM call.
- [ ] `sync_accounts` with billing=agent → same, but natural key includes the calling agent's id; two agents syncing the same `(operator, brand)` produce two distinct Accounts.
- [ ] `sync_accounts` with sandbox=true → Account immediately `active` and wired to per-tenant sandbox advertiser. No GAM CompanyService.createCompanies call (advertiser was created lazily on first sandbox call ever, reused thereafter).
- [ ] `create_media_buy` for `pending_provision` Account on tenant with `auto_provision_advertisers=true` → calls `GAMOrdersManager.create_advertiser`, persists id on `Account.platform_mappings.google_ad_manager.advertiser_id`, flips Account to `active`, proceeds with the buy.
- [ ] `create_media_buy` for `pending_provision` Account on tenant with `auto_provision_advertisers=false` → raises `ACCOUNT_NOT_PROVISIONED`. Admin UI shows the account with a "Map advertiser" prompt.
- [ ] Two media buys against the same `pending_provision` Account in quick succession (race) → only one GAM CompanyService.createCompanies call (idempotency on the provision step keyed by `account_id`).
- [ ] Advertiser-name collision in GAM → existing advertiser id is attached, no error. Audit log records the attach.
- [ ] Tenant Management API `POST /tenants/provision` accepts `auto_provision_advertisers` in the request; default `true` for embedded-mode tenants (`is_embedded=true`), `false` otherwise.
- [ ] Existing open-instance tenants unaffected after migration — `auto_provision_advertisers=false` by default keeps today's manual-mapping flow intact.

## Open questions

1. **GAM dry-run semantics** — does `dry_run=true` on order create produce visible-but-non-serving Orders, or reject at the API? Affects whether sandbox shares the production GAM network or needs its own.
2. **Cross-agent advertiser sharing on operator-billed accounts** — when two buyer agents sync the same `(operator, brand_domain, brand_id)` with `billing=operator`, do they end up sharing one Account row (current natural key) or get separate `AgentAccountAccess` rows pointing at one Account? Today it's the latter; confirm that's still right for embedded mode.
3. **Provisioning idempotency** — what happens if the GAM `CompanyService.createCompanies` call succeeds but the salesagent's commit-to-DB fails? On retry we'd duplicate the advertiser. Mitigation: `create_advertiser` always queries existing-by-name first, OR persist intent before the GAM call (`Account.platform_mappings.advertiser_create_pending=true`) and reconcile on retry.
4. **Manual mapping UX** — the Admin UI's existing GAM advertiser picker shows all advertisers in the network. For large publishers (10k+ advertisers), it needs search. Out of scope here; flag for the Admin UI sprint.

## Sprint placement

This work fits in **Sprint 1.6 or Sprint 4** of the managed-tenant-mode plan. Lighter than Sprint 4's full publisher-CRUD scope; depends on Sprint 1's Tenant Management API existing (which it does). Recommend landing as a discrete sprint right after 1.5 since Scope3's first real `create_media_buy` will hit `ACCOUNT_NOT_PROVISIONED` without it.

Estimated scope: ~3 days.
- 0.5d migrations + Tenant flag.
- 1d sync_accounts + create_media_buy branching.
- 0.5d GAM `create_advertiser` helper + sandbox-advertiser bootstrap.
- 0.5d Admin UI "Map advertiser" button + endpoint.
- 0.5d tests (provision happy path, manual-required path, sandbox carve-out, race idempotency, name-collision-as-attach).
